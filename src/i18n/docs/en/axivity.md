General Device Introduction
---------------------------

The Axivity (AX6) is a wrist worn sensor for monitoring and recording movement including _body position, acceleration,_ and _direction_ . This data can be used to identify activities, such as sitting, walking, falling, etc. Axivity records data every second and stores it inside the small black sensor “puck” (Figure 1).

**How does this device look?**

Axivity comes in two parts: a silicone strap and a small sensor “puck” as illustrated in **Figure 1,** which is inserted inside the wristband and worn on the wrist (Figure 2).

**What does it record?**

The Axivity automatically records anonymised movement data on the sensor “puck”. This data includes: your _position of wrist_ , the _acceleration_ and the _direction_ that you move.

**How is it used?**

Axivity is worn on the **non-dominant** wrist - i.e. the side you use less - using the provided silicone strap during day and night. It can be worn for up to 9 days without having to be recharged and is suitable for day-to-day activities, including showering and bathing, but must not be worn for activities such as diving, swimming, and sauna/steam rooms.
