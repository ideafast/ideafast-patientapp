<p>MoveMonitor records your movement as you go about your daily life, such as walking and sleeping. The movement data collected can be used to calculate a range of assessments, such as energy expenditure. MoveMonitor can record data for up to 7 days without needing to be charged.</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>The device is a flat white sensor (Figure 1), it is easy to clean and wear at the lower back using the elastic strap provided (Figure 2). <strong>My McRoberts</strong> is a website (Figure 3) for configuring the MoveMonitor sensor prior to use in research.</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p>MoveMonitor automatically records anonymised movement data, such as_position_of body and the_speed_and_direction_that you move. My McRoberts then uses this data to create reports such as energy expenditure or movement during sleep.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>MoveMonitor is worn on the lower back (waist) using the elastic strap provided for 24/7 monitoring and up to 7 days of continuous measurements. The device is<strong>not waterproof</strong>and can be either worn on the skin or over clothing (preferably the first layer).</p>

<p>N DAYS= 5 days, up to 7 days of continuous measurement.</p>

<p>Make sure you wear the device in the position indicated by your clinician for the advised time frame. Your study period may last up to ($TIME_PERIOD – N DAYS) days. You will wear the sensor 24/7 - also during sleeping. Make sure you wear the MoveMonitor correctly. The device should be worn around the waist, at the middle of the lower back. The engraved McRoberts logo should be readable, and the waist belt should be on the inside. It can be worn directly on the skin or over a thin layer of clothes. Please note that the MoveMonitor is not waterproof, so it is not suitable for showering, bathing or swimming.</p>

<p>No. After ($TIME_PERIOD – N DAYS) days you will be contacted by a clinician and will either (i) be provided with a new device; (ii) meet a clinician to return the device and retrieve your data; or (iii) receive another device to wear.</p>

<p>Yes. You will be contacted by a clinician to see how your full period of use has been. They will complete an evaluation questionnaire with you over the phone (or by visiting you at your home). You can give the researcher your device in person or by posting it back to the centre in order to retrieve your data.</p>

<p>The MoveMonitor is a device that is worn with an elastic strap around the waist, powered by an internal battery. It collects physical activity data of a subject for up to 7 days (24/7). Programming and data retrieval are done by a (healthcare) professional and devices can be re-used.</p>

<p>The battery lasts for the entire measurement, you do not need to recharge the device during the measurement. The LED’s on the device will only give feedback during the first 5 minutes of the measurement. After that, they will be switched off.</p>

<p>In case the battery does run empty the LED will blink red, for example, when the device was not fully charged before the start of the measurement. Please contact the study centre below if this occurs.</p>

<p>It is recommended to wear the device (using the elastic belt) over a thin layer of clothing (e.g. T-shirt). Ideally, the MoveMonitor device should be worn over the same or similar piece of clothing and in the same place daily to ensure comparable data is collected.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-usage-pattern">
<a class="anchor" href="#adjust-usage-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjust usage pattern?</h3>

<p>It is recommended to wear the sensor 24/7 as the project aims to investigate sleep and fatigue.</p>
