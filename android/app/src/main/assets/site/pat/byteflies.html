<p>Sensor Dots by Byteflies is a multimodal wearable device to continuously record physiological signals, in home or in the clinic. Sensor dot can be placed in multiple places on the body to record different types of physiological signals.</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>The Sensor Dot is a small blue device (see pictures below) with an LED light indication. Byteflies device comprises the main sensor the Sensor Dot (figure 1), the Sensor Patch (figure 1) and the docking station (figure 2). Sensors Dots are placed into Sensor Patches that can stick on the body and take measurements. The docking station is used to charge the Sensor Dots and transfer data on the Byteflies Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sensor Dots</strong> record high quality <strong>brain</strong> (electroencephalography, EEG), <strong>heart</strong> (electrocardiography, ECG) and <strong>muscle activity</strong> (electromyography, EMG), as well as <strong>eye motion</strong> (electrooculography, EOG) and general <strong>motion data</strong> (3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope).</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>Sensor Dot is placed in Sensor Patch and then sticks on the indicated location on the body. Sensor Dots can be worn in multiple locations on the body in the same time. It allows continuous measurement up to 24 hours and can be worn during sleep. Contact with water should be avoided – Sensor Dot is water resistant but not waterproof.</p>

<p>Yes. You need to make sure you wear, clean and charge the Sensor Dots that the clinician has provided you with. You also need to make sure that the docking station stays connected with a power supply and Wi-Fi, if possible. You need to wear three (3) of the Sensor Dots in the indicated body locations - at your head, your chest and your leg - and charge the three (3) remaining Sensor Dots by placing them on the docking station. You need to alternate them every 24 hours; this means, you place the three (3) Sensor Dots you were wearing back on the docking station to charge them, and you wear the three (3) Sensor Dots that have been charging. You need to repeat this daily (every 24 hours).</p>

<p>While wearing the Sensors Dots, make sure that the Sensor Dots and Sensor Patches stay stable on the body position your clinician advised you to wear. Avoid any contact with water. If the sensor moves or feels unstable – for instance, the patch’s glue wears out, the sensor falls, or a cable (electrode) is detached – contact your clinician as soon as possible.</p>

<p>During wearing, the light on the Sensor Dot should be blinking green - this means the Sensor Dot is recording correctly. If the sensor light turns off or turns red, it is very likely that the sensor needs recharging or there is a technical issue; in both cases you should contact your clinician as soon as possible.</p>

<p>After $TIME_PERIOD you will either (i) be provided a new device by a clinician; (ii) visit a clinician and they will transfer data for you; (iii) be asked to keep the device and retrieve the data from the device yourself or (iv) receive another device to wear. They will contact you to arrange an appointment one-week period to the $TIME_PERIOD. If no specific arrangements are made, the device will simply be returned at the end of the study period.</p>

<p>Data transfer will be assessed by your clinician or yourself after $TIME_PERIOD – subject to independent arrangement with your clinician. In the case, you are asked to retrieve data yourself, you need to connect docking station to Wi-Fi. Data transfer is achieved when Sensor Dots are placed on the docking station and when the docking station is connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to Wi-Fi but your clinician insists that you connect the docking station to Wi-Fi yourself, you will then be provided with a mobile device that will be used as an internet hotspot. Please ask your clinician for further details and support on using the hotspot.</p>

<p>To connect the docking station to Wi-Fi yourself, please follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the charger cable to the Byteflies docking station and plug the device to the power.</li>
</ol>

<p>1) Connect with the BF-XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX network and enter the provided password. The password can be found in the IFU on the first page. Please ask your clinician about the password if you have not been provided with the IFU.</p>

<p>2) In your browser, navigate to <a href="http://192.168.51.97/">http://192.168.51.97</a> . Here you will see a webpage where you can connect the docking station with your own 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. This is required so that data can be uploaded from the hub to the web.</p>

<p>3) Look in the list on the webpage to your own Wi-Fi-network and click ‘Connect’. After a few seconds the Wi-Fi-status above will indicate ‘Connected to [Your own Wi-Fi-network]’. If this isn’t the case, try again. When this doesn’t work after a few tries, contact Byteflies at arno@byteflies.com</p>

<p>Sensor Dots by Byteflies is a multimodal wearable device to continuously record physiological signals, in home or in the clinic. Sensor dot can be placed in multiple places on the body to record different types of physiological signals. It can measure electroencephalography (EEG), as well as other biopotential signals (ECG, EMG, EOG, etc.) and motion data (IMU).</p>

<ul>
  <li>What will I need to do before I can start using this?</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be provided with six (6) Sensor Dots, Sensor Patches and one (1) docking station.</p>

<p>Your clinician will help you stick the Sensor Patches in specific locations on your body. These will remain there for the study period. Make sure the skin area where the sensor will be positioned is clean and any hair is removed. In case the glue wears out or there is skin irritation, advice you clinician as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Your clinician will show you how to place the Sensor Dots in the Sensor Patches glued on your body. The Sensor Dot should be cleaned with a wipe before usage.<strong>Avoid any water on the sensor throughout the study period – you need to remove Sensor Dots when going for a shower.</strong></p>

<p>You will wear three (3) Sensor Dots and charge the other three (3) on the docking station. You will wear them 24/7 (during the day and night) and alternate them every 24 hours with the ones that have been charged. In order to charge them, you place them in the slots at the docking station. You need to make sure that the docking station stays connected with a power supply.</p>

<p>If the light of the Sensor Dot turns red or off (no light) then the sensor has stopped working. In the case of red light, the sensor has potentially a technical error and should be temporarily removed from the study. Byteflies should be contacted in the case of a technical error. In the case of no light, the sensor Dot has run out of battery and should be recharged. In both cases, contact your local study centre as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="battery">
<a class="anchor" href="#battery" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Battery?</h3>

<p>In the case where the Sensor Dot light turns off, the sensor’s battery needs recharging. To charge the Sensor Dots, you need to place them on the Docking station and connect the docking station with a power supply.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">
<a class="anchor" href="#connectivity-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>There might be a difficulty connecting the Docking station with the internet; in that case repeat both steps as described in Section 3. If the difficulty remains, contact Byteflies.</p>

<p>If the Sensor Dot feels stable but you find it uncomfortable to wear, consider changing cloths. If the Sensor Dot or the electrodes feel unstable, contact your clinician as soon as possible to help you stabilise it. If you notice any skin irritation, remove the Sensor Patch and the electrodes and contact your clinician as soon as possible. If the Sensor Dot is placed on the head, a mild discomfort is normal; please consult with your clinician on how to make it more comfortable for you.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-wear-style">
<a class="anchor" href="#adjust-wear-style" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjust wear style?</h3>

<p>Any cloths should be suitable to wear; depending on the location of the Sensor Dot, lose or tight clothes and the use of elastic bands might create a different feeling. Advice your clinician in order to find what works best for you.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-usage-pattern">
<a class="anchor" href="#adjust-usage-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjust usage pattern?</h3>

<p>If you feel wearing the Sensor Dot works better during certain hours of the day whereas it creates discomfort during others; talk to your clinician on how to adapt the usage pattern better to fit with your needs and the study needs.</p>
