<p>You will be provided with a <strong>Samsung Galaxy A40</strong> <strong>smartphone</strong> for the duration of this study. Its purpose is to connect and transfer data between the sensing devices that you wear and the smartphone where they have an associated mobile application. The smartphone will have 7 <strong>applications</strong> preinstalled and configured for use with the associated sensing devices or during the study, including: <strong>VitalPatch, Biovotion, ZK1 YOLI, Dreem, VTT Stress Monitor, CamCog ThinkFast, and IDEA-FAST Support Documentation</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>VTT Stress Monitor App</strong> and <strong>CamCog</strong> record data about phone usage or send prompts to complete short questionnaires daily. Because these applications will send notifications at pre-defined times and are intended to also record patterns of how you use your personal mobile device, it is recommended that they are <em>not</em> used on the Samsung Hub device. Instead, they should be installed on the participants <em>personal mobile smartphone,</em> and if the participant <strong><em>does not have a mobile smartphone or does not consent for these applications to be installed on their personal device, then they should be used on the Samsung device.</em></strong></p>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The Samsung A40 smartphone will automatically connect to the preconfigured sensing devices if they are within range (typically a few meters) and transfer data from each using the preinstalled mobile phone applications. Note that not all devices will be connected to the study phones. The information materials for each device contains further details. Once you have an internet connection, some of the sensing device applications will upload the data from the Samsung device to the cloud where researchers of the study can view it. <strong><em>It is important that you carry the Samsung device within two meters of you while wearing any sensing devices and that it is charged each night to ensure it can transfer data.</em></strong></p>

<p>Depending on your individual study participation pattern, the phone will either connect to the internet through your local WiFi, or it will come equipped with a 4G prepaid card. <strong>Please note that if the phone connects to the internet using a 4G prepaid card, we must ask participants not to use the phone for any unnecessary and data-intense online activities, such as watching videos online.</strong></p>

<p>When wearing either the VitalPatch or Biovotion (also known as Everion) you should check the smartphone twice per day – <em>in the morning and before bed</em> – to ensure the associated mobile applications are connected and have transferred data from daily wear of each device.</p>

<p>When you are using either or both the VitalPatch and Biovotion devices, their associated mobile applications will send a persistent notification to the Samsung device (Figure 1-2 below), which indicates the devices connection, battery status, and if data has been uploaded to the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Data will be automatically uploaded from the Samsung device to the cloud. After your full period of use ends in the trial, you must meet your clinician. They will take the Samsung device and retrieve any data remaining that has not been uploaded from it. The device will then be cleaned and prepared to be used by another study participant. Some study centres will arrange with you to return the devices via mail. If so, please follow any additional instructions provided by the study centre and make sure to power off the study phone before sending it off.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A40 is a mobile smartphone for use in the study to store and transfer data from some of the wearable devices that you will be asked to use. The smartphone will be preconfigured to include all the necessary mobile applications for the duration of this study. A separate mobile phone is provided to assure compatibility, to avoid having to ask you to install a lot of apps on your private device and as using multiple Bluetooth devices have an impact on battery duration. Having a unique phone with the sole purpose of recording data will ensure it lasts a full day without impacting your everyday use of your own mobile phone. Additionally, in case you do not want to install the <strong>StressMonitor</strong> and <strong>CamCog apps</strong> on your privately owned smartphone, or if you do not own a device that is compatible with these devices (such as not owning an Android device) then you can use these apps on the study phone.</p>
