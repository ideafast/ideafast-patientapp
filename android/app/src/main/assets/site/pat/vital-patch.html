<p>The VitalPatch is a disposable chest-worn sensor for monitoring vital signs, such as: heart rate, body temperature and movement. The VitalPatch records data and stores it on the device every few seconds. The patch then sends this data to a mobile application via Bluetooth when it has a connection. The battery in the patch lasts for five-days and cannot be recharged.</p>

<p>The VitalPatch is applied to one of two positions in the upper left side of the chest as illustrated to the right. Body hair should be removed where the patch will be placed to ensure a good connection. It can be worn during a shower but exposure directly under the shower head should be minimal. Do not submerge the VitalPatch in water or use in a sauna.</p>

<p>To start using a VitalPatch, please follow the instructions <a href="#as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-after-my-full-periods-of-use-of-a-specific-device--app-ends">below</a> to attach the VitalPatch to your chest and turn it on. Once the VitalPatch is turned on, it will automatically connect to its mobile application on the provided Samsung device and transfer data if the phone has Bluetooth enabled and is within range. As data is transferred via Bluetooth (in a range of 10 metres (32ft)), we recommend that you always carry the provided smartphone with you. If you lose connectivity between the patch and mobile phone, data is stored on the patch and will be transmitted once the phone has connectivity again. Please ensure that the mobile device provided to you (“study phone”) is placed near your bed when you sleep to accommodate data transfer in the night. You need to ensure the mobile device is kept charged.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#step-1-handling-vitalpatch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Handling VitalPatch</h2>

<p>Prior to applying the VitalPatch to your chest you must clean and dry your hands to remove any dirt. Do not touch the adhesive on the VitalPatch.</p>

<div class="desktop">

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/17.jpeg" alt=""></td>

<h2 id="step-2-prepare-skin">
<a class="anchor" href="#step-2-prepare-skin" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 2: Prepare skin</h2>

<p>The VitalPatch should be attached on the_upper left chest (left-hand side for the wearer). If the device cannot be placed here, then use the second application site instead:</p>

<div class="desktop">

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/18.jpeg" alt=""></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<div class="mobile">

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/18.jpeg" alt=""></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<p>The second application site is located just left of the centreline, below the chest on the rib cage. For a good connection and proper operation, the patch should NOT be worn over areas with a lot of body hair. Remove body hair in the area of device placement before applying the device. See image to the left.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-remove-vitalpatch-from-pouch">
<a class="anchor" href="#step-3-remove-vitalpatch-from-pouch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 3: Remove VitalPatch from pouch</h2>

<p>Tear open the pouch using the notch mark and remove the device carefully to <strong><em>avoid pressing the Power Button</em></strong>. Please do not yet dispose of the pouch or the adhesive backing with the device Bluetooth ID number as you will need this information to connect to the mobile application. The Bluetooth ID number can be found on the pouch label or on the adhesive backing in both human readable and barcode formats.</p>

<div class="desktop">

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/19.jpeg" alt=""></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/19.jpeg" alt=""></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Clean the chest area before use with soap and water and dry thoroughly. The application site should be free of oils and lotions to maximise adhesion. You must shave this area with a razor to be free from any hair. After showering or exposing the device to water, please wipe it down with a dry cloth. This ensures that the label printed onto the device does not peel off.</p>

    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<p>Locate and press the Power Button off centred on the device. Look for a green light illuminating temporarily to confirm the device is powered on as illustrated in the image to the left. This button will only flash briefly and turns off afterwards (even though the patch is on). If you are not sure whether the device was turned on successfully, please continue to follow the next steps as instructed and you will be able to see whether turning the device on worked once you reach step 7 as the VitalPatch will connect to the mobile application and a notification will be displayed.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-position-patch-on-the-chest">
<a class="anchor" href="#step-5-position-patch-on-the-chest" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 5: Position patch on the chest.</h2>

<p>With the adhesive backings still adhered as shown in Step 4 above, place the patch on a flat body surface on the left chest with one side. This should be roughly two fingers below the collar bone and angled toward the heart as illustrated to the right. While the exact angle is not critical, it is more important to attach the patch to the flattest surface of the chest to prevent it slipping when moving. The battery side of the device should be pointed to the left side of the patient’s chest.</p>

<div class="desktop">

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/vital_patch/21.jpeg" alt=""></td>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The logo on the patch should be positioned so it is readable by someone facing you. The battery will be closest to the left side of the chest. If the device cannot be placed in the Primary Location use the Secondary Location instead, which is located just left of the centreline, below the rib cage as illustrated above.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-apply-patch-to-body">
<a class="anchor" href="#step-6-apply-patch-to-body" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 6: Apply patch to body.</h2>

<p>Hold one end of the patch against the chest. Lift the other side and grab the adhesive backing tab located near the centre of the device. Without touching the adhesive, pull the tab to remove the adhesive backing and press the patch down to apply. Repeat this process to apply the other side of the patch. Press down on both ends of the device to ensure it is well adhered to skin. Please avoid exercise and any exposure of the device to splash water for 30 minutes from when the VitalPatch is applied to your chest.</p>

<p>MBS Health Application automatically starts when the phone is switched on. If no VitalPatch is detected, it will keep searching until one is found. Please make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on the phone. Note: the green power light only flashes briefly when the patch is first turned on. The phone will indicate that the patch is synced (not the light). No user input is required. When the mobile device is switched on, the status of vital sign monitoring will appear as notifications</p>

<div class="desktop">

<p>There are three status messages that you will likely see during the trial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>“MBS Health service Started.”</strong> – when the VitalPatch is first connected.</li>
  <li>
<strong>“Monitoring on patch PATCH_ID.”</strong> – the VitalPatch is connected and automatically transferring data to the app.</li>
  <li>
<strong>“Trying to connect to patch.”</strong> – when the VitalPatch has lost connection, such as, when out of range. Note: the VitalPatch device will continue to try and connect until it is successful.</li>

<p>If VitalPatch does not automatically connect to the app within a few minutes, it may be the case that the power-on as instructed above in Step 4 did not work. If that appears to be the case, please attempt to power it up one more time as follows:</p>

<div class="desktop">

<p>VitalPatch is a chest-worn biosensor that continuously monitors vital signs for up to five days, such as heart rate and movement. Its lightweight design makes it less intrusive for daily wear and the data it records can help clinical professionals understand a range of medical conditions that were once only possible using large equipment in a hospital.</p>

<h3 id="battery">
<a class="anchor" href="#battery" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Battery?</h3>

<p>The battery of the VitalPatch will last 5 days. If the battery is dead, you will not be able to connect in the mobile application as outlined above, and no further data will be recorded. If data has not yet been synchronised to the phone using the app before the VitalPatch runs out of battery, then any data not yet transferred is lost.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">
<a class="anchor" href="#connectivity-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>If connection to your mobile device has failed, check that your mobile device supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and that the Bluetooth settings on your mobile device are on. If Bluetooth is enabled but the connection still fails, restart your mobile device and try connecting again. If the battery in your patch is exhausted, you will not be able to connect.</p>

<p>If for any reason during the study the HealthStream mobile application is searching for the patch for <strong>more than 30 minutes</strong> even though it is in range and patch is still within 5 days battery, please <a href="https://docs.ideafast.eu/pat/hubphone#restarting-phone">restart the provided Samsung Smartphone</a>.</p>

<p>VitalPatch should be worn 24-hours a day for 5 consecutive days. Once the VitalPatch is attached to the chest it should not be removed. However, if it becomes extremely uncomfortable to wear, hot, or causes skin irritation, please remove it and contact the study site team immediately. Do not wear the devices over any open wounds or irritated skin.</p>
