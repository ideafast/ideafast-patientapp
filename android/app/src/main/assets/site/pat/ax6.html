<p>The Axivity (AX6) is a wrist worn sensor for monitoring and recording movement including <em>body position, acceleration,</em> and <em>direction</em> . This data can be used to identify activities, such as sitting, walking, falling, etc. Axivity records data every second and stores it inside the small black sensor “puck” (Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>Axivity comes in two parts: a silicone strap and a small sensor “puck” as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1,</strong> which is inserted inside the wristband and worn on the wrist (Figure 2).</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p>The Axivity automatically records anonymised movement data on the sensor “puck”. This data includes: your <em>position of wrist</em>, the <em>acceleration</em> and the <em>direction</em> that you move.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>Axivity is worn on the <strong>non-dominant</strong> wrist - i.e. the side you use less - using the provided silicone strap during day and night. It can be worn for up to 9 days without having to be recharged and is suitable for day-to-day activities, including showering and bathing, but must not be worn for activities such as diving, swimming, and sauna/steam rooms.</p>

<p>Yes. You will be asked to wear the Axivity wristband for <strong>5-days, then take a 2-day break from wearing it, then wear it for a final 5 days</strong> . Please charge the device during the 2-day break period so that it becomes fully charged.</p>

<p>After the complete study period you will either: (i) be provided a new device by a clinician; (ii) visit a clinician and they will transfer data for you; or (iii) receive another device to wear.</p>

<p>No. Transferring data from Axivity will be managed by your clinician. They will contact you to arrange an appointment after the study period. If no specific arrangements are made, the device will simply be returned together with all other devices at the end of the study period.</p>

<p>Yes. After your full period of use ends in the trial, you must go to the study site. The research team will take the device and transfer your data from it.</p>
