<p><img src="../images/zk/1.jpeg" alt="">The YOLI Sleep Monitor uses a Wi-Fi signal (radar) for monitoring and recording respiratory rate without requiring any interaction with the device. It can sense body movement up to 3 meters from the device and can detect different sleep conditions, such as sleep apnoea.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-device-look">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-device-look" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this device look?</h2>

<p>The YOLI is a small white box (Figure 1) that must be connected to Wi-Fi using a separate mobile application and should be placed next to your bed at waist height, such as on a bedside cabinet (Figure 2). The device has a power button on the front that can be used for turning it off when not in use, i.e. not sleeping. The YOLI has a yellow-green light on the side that shows Wi-Fi connectivity, which will always be on when the device is working correctly, or slowly flashing when it does not have a working internet connection.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it record?</h2>

<p>The YOLI automatically records respiration rate of nearby people every minute during the night.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The YOLI should be placed near your bed, ideally on a bedside table and at waist height (Figure 2). Once it is connected to a power source and added to your home Wi-Fi, or to a Wi-Fi hotspot provided by the study phone (if no home Wi-Fi is available), it will automatically begin monitoring your sleep health. Before you go to sleep, please make sure to use the switch on the front of the device (Figure 1) to turn it on and make sure the indicator light is on and not flashing. When you wake up and start your day, please turn the device off during the day to conserve energy and data bandwidth.</p>

<p>Yes. You should manually connect the YOLI mobile application to your home WiFi and ensure that the YOLI device is turned on during the agreed monitoring periods and placed close to your bed. The YOLI device will automatically record your heart rate and breathing rate when turned on. Guidance for how to connect to WiFi are <a href="#connecting-to-wi-fi-first-use-only">described below</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to power on the YOLI device and connect it to Wi-Fi on its first us. The device needs to be plugged in to its associated 12V power supply as outlined below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/21.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="any-account-setup-required">
<a class="anchor" href="#any-account-setup-required" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Any account setup required?</h3>

<p>No. The YOLI application will come pre-installed on the provided Samsung A40 smartphone.</p>

<h4 id="connecting-to-wi-fi-first-use-only">
<a class="anchor" href="#connecting-to-wi-fi-first-use-only" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connecting to Wi-Fi (first use only)</h4>

<p>Turn on the YOLI device, then long press the touch key which is on the front of the device until the light on the side is quickly flashing. The light is quickly flash when the device is waiting to configure the Wi-Fi. Once the Wi-Fi tool application is open, you will see screenshot as below. You should then connect the YOLI device to your home Wi-Fi using the associated YOLI application on the Samsun A40 smartphone. Tap the icon on the home screen to open the mobile application:</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/22.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once open, the home screen will show YOLO Wi-Fi configuration user interface where you need to enter the name and password of your home WiFi. This is required for YOLI to automatically upload data. If you are unsure what your home WiFi SSID (name) and password are, these are typically written on the back of your router that provides Internet to your home.</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/23.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you do not have a home Wi-Fi, please enable and use the provided smartphone’s Wi-Fi hotspot as <a href="https://docs.ideafast.eu/pro/hubphone#enabling-hotspot">described here</a>.</p>

<p>If the YOLI device does not appear, please turn the YOLI on and off from the switch:</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#needs-pairing-with-hub-device" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Needs pairing with hub-device?</h3>

<p>Yes. The YOLI application will come pre-installed on the provided Samsung A40 smartphone and needs to be used to link the YOLI device to a Wi-Fi internet connection.</p>

<h3 id="any-configuration--assembly-required">

<a class="anchor" href="#which-room-should-it-go-in" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Which room should it go in?</h3>

<p>When the patient sleeps on the bed or sits in the chair, the device needs to be placed as shown in Figure. 1. Note that the patient needs to keep still (without body movement), the device can monitor the patient breath in a contactless manner. The distance between the device and the human target needs to be less than 3m.</p>
