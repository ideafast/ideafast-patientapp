<p>The VitalPatch is a disposable chest-worn sensor for monitoring vital signs, such as: heart rate, body temperature and movement. The Vital records data and stores data on the device every few seconds and. The patch then sends this data to a mobile application via Bluetooth when it has a connection. The battery in the patch lasts for five-days and cannot be recharged.</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/primarysecondary.png" alt="">
The VitalPatch is applied to one of two positions in the upper left side of the chest as illustrated to the right. Body hair should be removed where the patch will be placed to ensure a good connection. It can be worn during a shower but exposure directly under the shower head should be minimal. Do not submerge the VitalPatch in water or use in a sauna.</p>

<p>For first time useSo start using a VitalPatch, please follow the instructions in <a href="http://link/">Section 4</a> to pair the VitalPatch with your mobile device (the phone provided to you for this study). Once the VitalPatch is attached to your chest and turned on, it will automatically connect to its mobile application on the provided Samsung device and transfer data. As data is transferred via Bluetooth (in a range of 10 metres (32ft)), we recommend that you always carry the provided smartphone with you. If you lose connectivity between the patch and mobile phone, data is stored on the patch and will be transmitted once the phone has connectivity again. Please ensure that yourthe mobile device provided to you ("study phone") is placed near your bed when you sleep to accommodate data transfer in the night. You need to ensure the mobile device is kept charged.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#device-how-to--setup-for-wear" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Device How To / setup for wear</h1>

<p>The VitalPatch must be applied to the chest whereso that the logo side and battery are facing upwards, as shown in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/topbottomview.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> <em>the top (to power on) and bottom (to attach to skin) view of the VitalPatch.</em></p>

<p>_ <strong>There are</strong> _ _ <strong>seven steps</strong> _ _ <strong>to preparing and applying the VitalPatch to your chest and connecting it to the HealthStream application:</strong> _</p>

<p><em>Step 1: Handling VitalPatch</em></p>

<p>Prior to applying the VitalPatch to your chest you must clean and dry your hands to remove any dirt. Do not touch the adhesive on the VitalPatch. <img src="../images/vital_patch/grasp.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Step 2: Prepare skin</em></p>

<p>The VitalPatch should be attached on the <em>upper left chest (left-hand side for the wearer)</em>. If the device cannot be placed here, then use the second application site instead (see Figure N). The second application site is located just left of the centreline, below the chest on the rib cage. For a good connection and proper operation, the patch should NOT be worn over areas with a lot of body hair. Remove body hair in the area of device placement before applying the device. See image to the left. <img src="../images/vital_patch/sides.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Step 3: Remove VitalPatch from pouch</em></p>

<p>Tear open the pouch using the notch mark and remove the device carefully to _ <strong>avoid pressing the Power Button</strong> _ <strong>.</strong> RetainPlease do not yet dispose the pouch or the adhesive backing with the device Bluetooth ID number as you will need this information to connect to the mobile application. The Bluetooth ID number can be found on the pouch label or on the adhesive backing in both human readable and barcode formats. <img src="../images/vital_patch/pouch.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Clean the area before use with soap and water and dry thoroughly. The application site should be free of oils and lotions to maximise adhesion. You must shave this area with a razor to be free from any hair.</p>

<p><em>Step 4: Power-on the VitalPatch</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/poweron.png" alt=""> Locate and press the Power Button off centred on the device. Look for a green light illuminating temporarily to confirm the device is powered on as illustrated in the image to the left. This button will only flash briefly and turns off afterwards (even though the patch is on). If you are not sure whether the device was turned on successfully, please continue to follow the next steps as instructed and you will be able to see whether turning the device on worked once you reach step 7.</p>

<p><em>Step 5: Position patch on the chest.</em></p>

<p>With the adhesive backings still adhered (see image to the right), place the patch on a flat body surface on the left chest with one side. This should be roughly two fingers below the collar bone and angled toward the heart as illustrated to the right. While the exact angle is not critical, it is more important to attach the patch to the flattest surface of the chest to prevent it slipping when moving. The battery side of the device should be pointed to the left side of the patient's chest. <img src="../images/vital_patch/primarysecondarylocation.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The logo on the patch should be positioned so it is readable by someone facing you. The battery will be closest to the left side of the chest. If the device cannot be placed in the Primary Location use the Secondary Location instead, which is located just left of the centreline, below the rib cage as illustrated above (see Figure N).</p>

<p><em>Step 6: Apply patch to body.</em></p>

<p>Hold one end of the patch against the chest. Lift the other side and grab the adhesive backing tab located near the centre of the device. Without touching the adhesive, pull the tab to remove the adhesive backing and press the patch down to apply. Repeat this process to apply the other side of the patch. Press down on both ends of the device to ensure it is well adhered to skin. Please avoid exercise and any exposure of the device to splash water for 30 minutes from when the VitalPatch is applied to your chest. <img src="../images/vital_patch/apply.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Step 7: Connecting to Mobile Application</em></p>

<p>MBS Health Application automatically starts when the phone is switched on. If no VitalPatch is detected, it will keep searching until one is found. Please make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on the phone. Note: the green power light only flashes briefly when the patch is first turned on. The phone will indicate that the patch is synced (not the light). No user input is required. When the mobile device is switched on, the status of vital sign monitoring will appear as notifications as illustrated below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/phonestatus.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There are three status messages that you will likely see during the trial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>" <strong>MBS Health service Started."</strong> – when the VitalPatch is first connected.</li>
  <li>" <strong>Monitoring on patch PATCH_ID."</strong> – the VitalPatch is connected and automatically transferring data to the app.</li>
  <li>" <strong>Trying to connect to patch."</strong> – when the VitalPatch has lost connection, such as, when out of range. Note: the VitalPatch device will continue to try and connect until it is successful.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Powering on the VitalPatch</em></p>

<p>If VitalPatch does not automatically connect to the app within a few minutes, it may be the case that the power-on as instructed above in Step 4 did not work. If that appears to be the case, please attempt to power it up one more time as follows:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/poweron.png" alt=""> Once the VitalPatch has been attached to your chest you can turn it on by pressing the Power Button. A green light will flash temporarily to confirm the device has been switched on. Once the device has been successfully activated, tThis light will not continue to flash during wear.</p>
