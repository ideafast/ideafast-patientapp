    <h1 id="general-application-introduction">General Application Introduction</h1>

<p>Stress Monitor is a mobile application that runs in the background and records anonymised data about other mobile application usage, movement activity, and location and uses this data to determine different types of behaviour. For example, if you had WhatsApp opened for 30 minutes when messaging friends, then Stress Monitor would record that you have used a “communication” application for 30-minutes while in location “1” where this number is used to represent your most frequent locations instead of actual geolocation information.</p>

<p>Stress Monitor also sends notifications to complete a short questionnaire as pre-determined times, which helps contextualise the mobile application usage data that it has recorded. These questionnaires relate to how you are feeling, are very short and can be completed within the Stress Monitor application.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-application-look">How does this application look?</h2>

<p>Stress Monitor is a mobile application, which has a <em>bonsai tree icon</em> (illustrated to the right) that will appear when you install the application.<img src="../images/stress_monitor/1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Stress Monitor has three screens – <em>Chart</em>, <em>Reporting</em> and <em>Settings</em> – that are illustrated below. <em>Chart</em> shows the categories it has created for your application usage over time. <em>Reporting</em> presents the number of entries Stress Monitor has recorded. <em>Settings</em> presents a link to the privacy policy and your user ID, which will appear as a long, randomly generated word.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">What does it record?</h2>

<p>Stress Monitor records three categories of data: (i) the types of_applications_ that you’re using on your smartphone (e.g. “communication” and “shopping”); (ii) a predication of your <em>movement</em> (e.g. “running”, “in vehicle”) and (iii) a number to represent your <em>location</em> to understand where movement and application usage occurs more generally, for example, if you use shopping applications more when at one location. All data recorded by Stress Monitor is anonymised.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">How is it used?</h2>

<p>There are two parts to Stress Monitor: (i) it automatically records application usage; and (ii) it sends questionnaire notifications. The first part requires no interaction with Stress Monitor as it will run in the background and record this data by itself.</p>

<p>Questionnaires are sent through Stress Monitor to help provide context for how you were feeling throughout the day at pre-determined times, which are currently <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00.</strong> A typical questionnaire is illustrated below to highlight its short length:</p>

<p><img src="../images/stress_monitor/5.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-on-a-daily-basis-or-all-n-days">As a patient: do I need to do anything on a daily basis or all N days?</h2>

<p>No. The <strong>Stress Monitor</strong> application records information in the background and will be installed on your personal smartphone. The application prompts questionnaires related to fatigue and sleep at pre-defined times: <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00.</strong> The questionnaires can be answered within one hour from the notification by clicking the banner on the top of screen, e.g. 9:00-10:00.</p>

<p>However, on your first visit you will need to download, install, and log into the stress monitor application on your personal Android smartphone or the provided smartphone. Once you are logged in, you will provide your <strong>hash id</strong> from within the application’s settings to the clinician. This helps us associate data collected within_stress monitor_ with other data collected through the study, such as eBedSensor. Details on how to view and access this are outlined in<a href="#needs-pairing-with-hub-device">section 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stress Monitor</strong> is a mobile application that runs in the background and records movement activity, location and information about your mobile usage, such as battery status. This data gives information about <em>behaviour</em> based on time, location and general mobile usage. Data is then grouped into categories, such as communication or social media.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The names of applications that are used are not stored anywhere, only the category that the application belongs to (e.g. communication/social) is collected.</li>
  <li>No data of the content of the applications (e.g. text typing, voice input) or the keystrokes is collected.</li>
  <li>No physical location data is collected. The location data is grouped into clusters with abstract identifiers (e.g. 1,2,3…) and only these identifiers are collected.</li>
  <li>No personal information is stored by the application that can be used to identify you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application also prompts questionnaires related to fatigue and sleep at pre-defined times: <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00,</strong> which must be answered within one hour by clicking the banner on the top of screen, e.g. 9:00-10:00. An example of the questionnaire appearing at 13:00 is presented in the figure below.</p>
