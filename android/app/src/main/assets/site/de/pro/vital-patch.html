<p>The VitalPatch is a disposable chest-worn sensor for monitoring vital signs, such as: heart rate, body temperature and movement. The Vital records data and stores data on the device every few seconds and. The patch then sends this data to a mobile application via Bluetooth when it has a connection. The battery in the patch lasts for five-days and cannot be recharged.</p>

<p>The VitalPatch records body movements and posture (standing, sitting, etc.), heart rate, respiratory (breathing) rate, body temperature and skin temperature.</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/primarysecondary.png" alt="">
The VitalPatch is applied to one of two positions in the upper left side of the chest as illustrated to the right. Body hair should be removed where the patch will be placed to ensure a good connection. It can be worn during a shower but exposure directly under the shower head should be minimal. Do not submerge the VitalPatch in water or use in a sauna.</p>

<p>As the patches are disposable you do not need to collect the patches. Please remind the participant to cut up the old patch before disposing to prevent any further data capture. This is required as the device attempts to continue to sync data to the phone until its battery runs out (which can be up to 6-7 days) and the mobile application can only sync to one patch at a time, i.e. if the old patch is still active it will continue to capture that data.</p>

<p>_ <strong>Retrieving VitalPatch Data</strong> _</p>

<p>After the full study period ends and the participant returns the provided smartphone you must manually transfer data from the VitalPatch application to the device hub. Data is stored on the internal storage of the associated MBS Health mobile application. Recorded data is composed of a two types of CSV files: (i) a "…vitals.cvs" file that stores heart rate, respiration, skin temperature, steps, posture and respiration rate interval (RRI); and (ii) an "…ECGecg.cvs" file containing raw ECG data. Each file will contain approximately <strong>20-minutes</strong> of stored vital sign data therefore, if a patient wears the device for two, 5-day periods, then there will be approximately 720 files of varying sizes. Each file is named: TIMESTAMP_PATCH_ID_NAME.csv, e.g. 553178863514_VC2B008BF_008579_vitals.csv</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/logdropdown.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> examples of the filenames (_vitals and _ecg) as stored on the mobile phone "log" folder.</p>

<p>_ <strong>Transferring Data from the Samsung SmartPhone</strong> _</p>

<p>Data is stored on the <em>internal storage</em> of the associated MBS Health mobile application at the following location:</p>

<p><strong>Internal Shared Storage -\&gt; /Android -\&gt; /data -\&gt; /com.vitalconnect.healthwatch.com -\&gt; /files -\&gt; /log</strong></p>

<p>To download this data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take the USB-C charging cable for the Samsung A40 and connect it from the phone to the Desktop PC's USB port. Wait for up to a minute to allow the phone to connect (it must be turned on and you may have to unlock the screen).</li>
  <li>Once connected, go to the Start Menu and search for "<strong>Android File Transfer (AFT)"</strong> and click on the program when it appears. It will look as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/aft.png" alt=""></p>

<ol>
  <li>When the phone is first connected to the Desktop PC the following message will appear. Click "Allow" to authorise the PC to access data from the phone. Once approved, you may need to reopen the Android File Transfer programme.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/allowaccess.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> When first connecting to an Android device you may need to _ <strong>allow</strong> _ <em>access to phone data</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once AFT is open, you will see a folder structure like the following:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/aftfolders.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> Default folder structure on the Samsung A40 device. <strong>Android</strong> is the folder of interest.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <strong>"\&gt;"</strong> icon on the left most side of <strong>"Android"</strong> as highlighted below:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/androiddropdown.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> Once you clicked "Android" you will see a list of all installed applications.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scroll down until you see " <strong>com.vitalconnect.healthwatch.com"</strong>. Double click on the <strong>"\&gt;"</strong> to view its contents. This will be two folders: <strong>"log"</strong> and <strong>"vci_logs"</strong> as illustrated below. The "log" folder contains all the data as illustrated below.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/filesdropdown.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> _ <strong>"com.vitalconnect.healthwatch.com"</strong> _ is towards the end of installed applications.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the <em>Android File Transfer</em> interface, click and drag the <strong>"files"</strong> folder that is located in " <strong>com.vitalconnect.healthwatch.com"</strong> onto your desktop. This will begin transferring the data from the mobile phone onto your desktop into a folder named "files". After 10 days wear, we expect many files (~720) aswith a combined file size of <strong>roughly</strong>  <strong>3.6GB</strong>. Transfer may take time.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/copying.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong> A transfer dialogue will appear on your screen when you begin transferring the files.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once the data is on your laptop, you must manually upload this to the IDEA-FAST project at: <a href="https://data.ideafast.eu/">https://data.ideafast.eu</a>

  <li>\&lt;\&lt; TODO: add deletion of device \&gt;\&gt;</li>
  <li><em>Once the raw data files have been downloaded from the mobile device, they must be deleted from the phone's storage. This will prevent any confusion if the phone is reused by another participant during the study.</em></li>

<p>Yes. Once VitalPatch is powered on, it will automatically pair with a nearby mobile phone that has the MBS Health application installed. Data is then transferred from the VitalPatch device to the app automatically. Please note that the devices do not need to be powered on before being handed to – or sent to – the study participants. The activation process is very simple and the support materials contain instructions for the patients so that they can activate the devices themselves once they start the actual wearing period for a VitalPatch device.</p>

<p>The battery of the VitalPatch will last 5 days. If the battery is dead, you will not be able to connect in the mobile application as outlined above, and no further data will be recordedtherefore, data will be lost. If data has not yet been synchronised to the phone using the app before the VitalPatch runs out of battery, then any data not yet transferred is lost.</p>

<p>If connection to your mobile device has failed, check that your mobile device supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and that the Bluetooth settings on your mobile device are on. If Bluetooth is enabled but the connection still fails, restart your mobile device and try connecting again. If the battery in your patch is exhausted, you will not be able to connect.</p>
