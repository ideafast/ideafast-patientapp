<p>The Axivity (AX6) is a wrist worn sensor for monitoring and recording movement including <em>body position, acceleration,</em> and <em>direction</em> . This data can be used to identify activities, such as sitting, walking, falling, etc. Axivity records data every second and stores it inside the small black sensor “puck” (Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>Axivity comes in two parts: a silicone strap and a small sensor “puck” as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1,</strong> which is inserted inside the wristband and worn on the wrist (Figure 2).</p>

  </tbody>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p>The Axivity automatically records anonymised movement data on the sensor “puck”. This data includes: your <em>position of wrist</em> , the <em>acceleration</em> and the <em>direction</em> that you move.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>Axivity is worn on the <strong>non-dominant</strong> wrist - i.e. the side you use less - using the provided silicone strap during day and night. It can be worn for up to 9 days without having to be recharged and is suitable for day-to-day activities, including showering and bathing, but must not be worn for activities such as diving, swimming, and sauna/steam rooms.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#as-a-professional-do-i-need-to-do-anything-on-a-daily-basis-or-all-n-days-for-each-patient-using-a-specific-device--app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>As a professional: do I need to do anything on a daily basis or all N days (for each patient using a specific device / app)?</h2>

<p>No. Anonymised movement data is stored on the Axivity device until it is retuned, at which point data will be removed. You do not need to do anything daily but will need to assure that a meeting is arranged with the patients at the end of their overall study participation so that you can retrieve the device. The data will then need to be transferred using the <strong>** and stored as a local backup using the **</strong> .</p>

<p>No. The AX6 will be set up to complete the full two weeks of continuous monitoring (see ) for each patient (it will keep monitoring during any break days). You will only need to take action after all device-use periods of an individual patient for the AX6 are completed (see <em>**</em> ).</p>

<p>Yes. After the wear period for the AX6 has ended, or at the latest at the end of the overall study participation period for each patient you must arrange a visit with (or by) the patient. When the patient brings the device, you must manually transfer data from it, recharge it.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring Data from the AX6:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>OMGUI is the windows software for activating the device, transferring data and viewing battery status. Find and click the desktop or start menu link to start OMGUI now.
    <ol>
      <li>If you can’t find the link, try to open an “Explorer” window and navigate to “ <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Movement\OM GUI</strong> ” and double-click on “OmGui.exe” to start OMGUI as illustrated below. If the path or file is not available, or if the program does not start, please see: .</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/3.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the micro-USB cable to the Axivity device and USB port. OMGUI will now detect the device. This may take up to a minute. If the device shows up in the list of devices of OMGUI, you can proceed with step 3.
    <ol>
      <li>If the connection is successful, the device should show up in the list of devices:</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/4.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>If the device does not show up in the list of devices after about 1 minute, please try to connect the Axivity device to another USB port on the computer.</li>
      <li>If you are using a USB-hub (a device that allows you to connect multiple USB devices to one USB-port on the computer at the same time), try to connect directly to the computer without using the USB-hub.</li>
      <li>Please note that a light should appear on the AX6 device when plugged in to the USB port. If this does not appear, it may take up to 5 minutes for the battery to reach an appropriate charge to function. If you have persistent problems with connection the device, please feel free to reach out to .</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Click “ <strong>Download</strong> ” and the data will be transferred from the device to a default location on your laptop – your ‘working folder’ as setup in . You can change your working folder by selecting File -&gt; Choose Working Folder. After N days use, we expect a n-MB file, so data transfer from the device to your computer may take some time.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/5.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>
<strong>Note:</strong> data transferred from the AX6 is copied and therefore still exists on the device. This should be manually removed following <strong>step 6 below</strong> once you confirm data has been uploaded to the idea fast portal and backed up locally.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Once the data is on your laptop, you must manually upload this to the IDEA-FAST project at: https://data.ideafast.eu
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to the portal and enter the required meta-data. When clicking the file upload / selection button in the portal, you can find the latest AX6 files in the folder indicated in the “ <strong>Workspace: …</strong> “ window in OMGUI:</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/6.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the file selector pop-up presented by your browser to select the file (or use drag-and-drop to start the upload to the datahub; please not that not all web-browsers will support this option).</li>
      <li>Please note that the *.cwa files recorded from the AX6 devices can be very large and the data upload may take a long time to complete.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Please also use the  to store a backup copy of the AX6 data file (*.cwa) on the IDEA-FAST backup hard-disk drive.</li>
  <li>Once you are certain that BOTH the file upload AND the local data backup have been successfully completed, please make sure to <strong>manually delete the data recording from the OMGUI workspace folder and clean the device with a damp cloth. I</strong> f the backup process completed successfully, the file may already have been deleted automatically.
    <ol>
      <li>To delete the data manually from OMGUI workspace, go to the path indicated as your workspace location (see picture below).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>At your workspace directory, you can manually delete the <strong>.cwa files</strong> (see below). They will also stop appearing in the OMGUI interface.</p>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/9.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>To delete the data from the AX6, select the device at the OMGUI window (which will turn it below as below) and click on the “ <strong>Clear</strong> ” button.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/10.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ol>
  <li>If the feasibility study has not yet concluded at your study centre, please continue with <em>**</em> in order to prepare the device for use by the next patient.
    <ol>
      <li>If the feasibility study has concluded at your study centre, or the device at hand will no longer be needed for further patients, please follow step .</li>
    </ol>

<a class="anchor" href="#configuration-and-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration and Analysis</h2>

<p>Configuration and analysis for AX6 is done through the Open Movement Graphical User Interface (OMGUI). OMGUI is an open source lightweight application that can be run on a computer with Windows PC with XP SP3 or later operating system and Microsoft .NET Framework v3.5 or later.</p>

<p>For installation instructions for OMGUI, please see . Further information on the required drivers and software can also be found at: <a href="https://axivity.com/downloads/ax3">https://axivity.com/downloads/ax3</a> .</p>

<p>OMGUI is designed for researchers to provide them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an easy to use interface to convert binary AX recordings</li>
  <li>access to validated analysis algorithms on recorded AX data.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the IDEA-FAST feasibility study, OMGUI will be used to (i) configure the settings for each AX6 device before it is given to a patient; and (ii) retrieve the data recorded from the device use by the patients during their study participation. Please see <em>**</em> for details on the required steps for data transfer.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#any-configuration--assembly-required" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Any configuration / assembly required?</h3>

<p>To start using the sensor, connect it to the computer using a USB port and launch the OMGUI software. For the IDEA-FAST feasibility study, please follow this protocol in order to prepare a device to be used by a patient:</p>

<p>Make sure the AX6 device that is to be supplied to the patient is connected to a USB port to charge on the day before it is handed to a patient and leave it plugged in for charging during the night.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>OMGUI</strong> is the windows software for activating the AX6, transferring data, and viewing battery status. Find and click the desktop or startmenu link to start OMGUI.
    <ul>
      <li>If you can’t find the link, open an “Explorer” window and type “C <strong>:\Program Files (x86)\Open Movement\OM GUI</strong> ” into the search bar at the top of the window. Double-click on “OmGui.exe” to start OMGUI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/13.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the path or file is not available, or if the program does not start, please see: .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>If not yet connected, connect the micro-USB cable to the Axivity device and USB port. OMGUI will now detect the device. This may take up to a minute. If the device shows up in the list of devices of OMGUI, you can proceed with step 3.
    <ul>
      <li>If the connection is successful, the device should show up in the list of devices:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/14.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>If the device does not show up in the list of devices after about 1 minute, please try to connect the Axivity device to another USB port on the computer.</li>
      <li>If you are using a USB-hub (a device that allows you to connect multiple USB devices to one USB-port on the computer at the same time), try to connect directly to the computer without using the USB-hub.</li>
      <li>Please note that a light should appear on the AX6 device when plugged in to the USB port. If this does not appear, it may take up to 5 minutes for the battery to reach an appropriate charge to function. If you have persistent problems with connection the device, please feel free to reach out to .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Complete configuration to begin 2 weeks (14 days) of recording on target start and end day for patient to use AX6. The device must be configured so that 2 weeks recording fit on the device (~50 Hz). Depending on when the starting day of the recording is set, the patient might be asked to recharge device before wear period starts. In order to configure the device for a new recording, select the device in the OMGUI and click on record.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/15.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>At the configuration window that appears, set the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Freq. (Hz): <strong>50</strong>
</li>
      <li>Recording Interval: Duration <strong>14 days</strong> – start and end date will vary depending on each patient.</li>
      <li>Further details such as <strong>Study Centre</strong> and <strong>Subject Details</strong> to be filled accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../images/ax6/16.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once setup is complete, allow the patient to use the sensor fitted on a wrist band for the intended duration. The recorded data will be transferred from the device to the study datahub and to the local backup hard-disk drive once the participant has completed their study participation period.</p>

<p>Please make sure that the devices are fully charged before handing them to patients:</p>
