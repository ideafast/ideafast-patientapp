<p>The ThinkFAST application will send you notifications at pre-determined times during the day to prompt and remind you to complete a short task. Although there are three tasks, you will be only asked to complete one per day and the tasks will change each day. Each task typically lasts only a few minutes. Each test requires different interactions, but broadly will involve opening the mobile application, and tapping on the screen to draw patterns or numbers.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-technology-look" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this technology look?</h2>

<p>CANTAB ThinkFAST is a mobile application that will appear as a green background and face in the icon when installed on your personal smartphone (Figure 1). ThinkFast uses an automated chat service to help authenticate your account, which you will need to do on your first clinical visit (Figure 2).</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it record?</h2>

<p>ThinkFAST records responses to specific tests that measure different aspects of cognition, such as, the time taken to draw a shape that previously appeared on the screen (Figure 1 and 3), or the time taken to react and write a number that appeared and disappeared from the screen (Figure 2).</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The ThinkFAST mobile application will send_two notifications_ per day to request the completion of one test: at 08:00, and a reminder at 9:30 if the tests have not yet been performed. These notifications are for the same test; there is only one test per day. The test sent to you each day will change between the three tests above. The following image shows how a notification will appear from the CANTAB ThinkFast application:</p>

<p>Check in the Connect administration tool that the expected data set exists for the participant. If so, advise the participant that they can now uninstall the app from their phone. If not, establish with the participant whether the app is indicating that there is outstanding data to upload and, if needed, help them to upload it.</p>

<p>N/A. The application will be downloaded onto either the participant’s own phone or the provided smartphone. It is preferred to be the participants personal smartphone as notifications will be sent at pre-defined times that they can more likely see and respond to.</p>

<h3 id="any-account-setup-required">
<a class="anchor" href="#any-account-setup-required" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Any account setup required?</h3>

<p>Yes. The CANTAB ThinkFAST app needs to be downloaded from the appropriate public app store to the phone. This will require the managed phone to be linked to an appropriate Play Store Account.</p>

<p>If the application is to be used on the participant’s own phone, then that participant needs to have an existing (or create) an account on either the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</p>

<p>Although the preference is for the application to be installed and used on the participant’s own phone, the app could be installed as standard on the provided smartphone so that, it is easy to fall-back to using it, should it not be possible to run the app on the subject’s own phone.</p>

<p>CANTAB ThinkFAST is a mobile application which can run on Android or iPhone. It is used for the collection of cognitive data from three brief tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>n-back test</em> of working memory and processing speed,</li>
  <li>the <em>Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)</em> that measures reaction times, and</li>
  <li>a digital version of the <em>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</em> that is a measure of processing speed and attention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants are asked to perform one test per day (rotating between the three tests). Data is captured on reaction time and response accuracy for all tasks. The app can schedule assessments and patients will receive notifications at predetermined times. This test may change between the weeks. You will receive a notification at pre-defined times (<strong>08:00, and a reminder at 9:30 if the tests have not yet been performed</strong>) to remind you to respond to the test. The test will be delivered through a mobile application.</p>

<p><em>N-Back test</em></p>

<p>The N-Back test is a measure of attention and working memory. Participants must determine if the stimulus on screen matches the stimulus shown two presentations ago. If it is a match, they should touch the screen, if it is not a match, they should make no response. The task begins with an instruction screen. Afterwards the participant is presented with a few examples for practice. During this practice phase, when there is a 2-back match, text appears on the screen to guide the participant to respond by touching the screen with their finger. The participant is informed that to provide feedback during the test, the screen will flash the following colours after they tap the screen (Green = correct response, Pink = incorrect response, Grey = too slow of a response). After a few practice stimuli the participant is asked to try a few more or continues to the main testing phase (depending on participant performance).</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>At this point the participant will begin the main phase of the test with no text instructions on the screen. They will still be provided with visual performance feedback via screen colour changes each time they tap the screen.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/8.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)</em></p>

<p>The Psychomotor Vigilance Task assesses how quickly a participant can react. The participant must look at the smartphone screen until a number appears. The participant should touch the screen as soon as they see the number.</p>

<p>These instructions introduce the PVT test to the participant and explains how the test is completed.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/9.jpeg" alt="">Next, the participant is presented with a few examples for practice. When an empty rectangle appears on screen, the participant must pay attention because a number will appear within the rectangle and begin rapidly counting upwards. The participant is asked to tap the screen as quickly as possible when they see the numbers count. If the participant responds before the numbers appear, text on the screen will notify the participant that they responded, ‘Too Soon’. If the participant does not respond quickly enough (5000ms) or does not respond at all, text on the screen will notify the participant that they have ‘Time Out’ and will move on to the next trial.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/10.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>After the participant has completed the brief practice session, the main task begins and will continue without breaks for approximately 3 minutes. The participant must continually pay attention during the test and respond as quickly as possible when a number appears within the rectangle.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/11.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)</em></p>

<p>The DSST is a global measure of cognitive ability, requiring the engagement of multiple cognitive domains in order to complete effectively. The task presents the participant with an array of abstract symbols associated with numbers. When a number is highlighted on screen, the participant must draw the corresponding abstract shape using their index finger on the smartphone.</p>

<p>The text instructions introduce the DSST test to the participant and explains how the test is completed.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/12.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Afterwards the subject is presented with a few examples for practice. When a number is highlighted on screen, the participant must draw the corresponding abstract shape using their index finger on the smartphone. The participant is asked to “<em>Try working through them quickly”.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_thinkfast/13.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>After the participant has completed the instructions and training portion, the timed portion of the test begins. The participant is instructed to complete as many symbols as possible within 90 seconds.</p>

<p>The CANTAB ThinkFAST mobile application will need to be installed on provided Samsung device and used there, only if the participant does not want to install and use it from one’s personal smartphone.</p>

<p>To “login” on the mobile application, you should first create a participant in the CANTAB system using the administration tool: <a href="https://app.cantab.com/admin">https://app.cantab.com/admin</a>. As part of this process, an identifier for the participant shall be assigned in the <strong>Connect system,</strong> which is the associated software installed on the provided iPad.</p>

<p>When the participant is in clinic, the app should be paired with the CANTAB Connect system as follows:</p>

  <li>The participant should download the CANTAB ThinkFAST app from either the Google Play Store or Apple App Store (as appropriate for the type of your phone).</li>
  <li>They should open the app and follow the instructions. The app will generate a 6-digit code, which they will provide to site staff.</li>
  <li>This will be entered into the CANTAB Connect system and this will activate the phone for use in the study.</li>
</ul>
