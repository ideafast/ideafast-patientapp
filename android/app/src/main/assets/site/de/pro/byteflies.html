<p><img src="../images/byteflies/1.jpeg" alt="">Sensor Dots by Byteflies is a multimodal wearable device to continuously record physiological signals, in home or in the clinic. Sensor dot can be placed in multiple places on the body to record different types of physiological signals.</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>The Sensor Dot is a small blue device (see pictures below) with an LED light indication. Byteflies device comprises from the main sensor the Sensor Dot (fig 1), the Sensor Patch (fig 1) and the docking station (fig 2). Sensors Dots are placed into Sensor Patches that can stick on the body and take measurements. The docking station is used to charge the Sensor Dots and transfer data on the Byteflies Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sensor Dots</strong> record high quality<strong>brain</strong> (electroencephalography, EEG),<strong>heart</strong> (electrocardiography, ECG) and<strong>muscle activity</strong> (electromyography, EMG), as well as<strong>eye motion</strong> (electrooculography, EOG) and general<strong>motion data</strong> (3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope).</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/byteflies/4.jpeg" alt="">Sensor Dot is placed in Sensor Patch and then sticks on the indicated location on the body. Sensor Dots can be worn in multiple locations on the body in the same time. It allows continuous measurement up to 24 hours and can be worn during sleep. Contact with water should be avoided – Sensor Dot is water resistant but not waterproof.</p>

<p>No. Anonymised movement data is stored on the Sensor Dot device for $TIME_PERIOD. You do not need to do anything daily but will need to assure that a meeting is arranged with the patients at the end of their overall study participation so that you can retrieve the device.</p>

<p>You need to be in contact and support the patient in case there is need. Sensors Dots are cleaned (see Section 7) and charged by the patient. Charging each Sensor Dot is required every 24 hours. You need to make sure that the patients charge, clean and wear the Sensor Dot devices properly. You need to make sure that the patients wear Sensor Patches in indicated locations on the body. You need make sure that Sensor Patches are replaced if necessary and patients have the support they need. You need make sure that all electrodes are cleaned and attached in required positions for the next measurement. To clean the Dot Sensors; see Section 7.</p>

<p>Yes. After ($TIME_PERIOD – N DAYS) of use you must arrange a meeting with the patient in order to retrieve the Sensor Dots. You must retrieve data from it and recharge it by placing it on the<strong>Docking Station.</strong> You need to make sure that the docking station is connected to a power supply and the Wi-Fi - Further instructions are provided in Section 3. As soon as the docking station is connected with Wi-Fi and the Sensor Dots are placed on the slots, the data transfer to the<strong>Byteflies IoT Manager - Cloud Platform</strong> will start automatically. Data transfer will take some time (hours) depending on the dataset sizes collected. Sensor Dots LED’s will have an orange colour indication when data transfer is in process, and they will turn green when the data transfer is completed. You then need to view and download all data that have been retrieved and stored on the<strong>Byteflies IoT Manager - Cloud Platform</strong>. The data will then need to be transferred using the<strong>**and stored as a local backup using the</strong>** - see further instructions in Section 3. The device will then be cleaned and prepared to be used by another study participant. See Sections 6 and 7. In the case you are not able to visit the patient to retrieve the data; you need to guide the patient to connect the docking station to the Wi-Fi himself/herself following the steps described in Section 3.</p>

<p>If the light of the Sensor Dot turns red or off (no light) then the sensor has stopped working. In the case of red light, the sensor has potentially a technical error and should be temporarily removed from the study. Byteflies should be contacted in the case of a technical error. In the case of no light, the sensor Dot has run out of battery and should be recharged. In both cases, contact your local study centre as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="battery">
<a class="anchor" href="#battery" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Battery?</h3>

<p>In the case where the Sensor Dot light turns off, the sensor’s battery needs recharging. To charge the Sensor Dots, you need to place them on the Docking station and connect the docking station with a power supply.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">
<a class="anchor" href="#connectivity-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>There might be a difficulty connecting the Docking station with the internet; in that case repeat both steps as described in Section 3. If the difficulty remains, contact Byteflies.</p>

<p>If the Sensor Dot feels stable but you find it uncomfortable to wear, consider changing cloths. If the Sensor Dot or the electrodes feel unstable, contact your clinician as soon as possible to help you stabilise it. If you notice any skin irritation, remove the Sensor Patch and the electrodes and contact your clinician as soon as possible. If the Sensor Dot is placed on the head, a mild discomfort is normal; please consult with your clinician on how to make it more comfortable for you.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-wear-style">
<a class="anchor" href="#adjust-wear-style" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adjust wear style?</h3>

<p>Any cloths should be suitable to wear; depending on the location of the Sensor Dot, lose or tight clothes and the use of elastic bands might create a different feeling. Advice your clinician in order to find what works best for you.</p>
