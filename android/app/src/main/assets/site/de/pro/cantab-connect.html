<p>CANTAB Connect is an iPad mobile application that has two components: (i) an administration area for clinical staff to login and create new participants as part of an ongoing study and to add those participants to the CANTAB ThinkFast app; and (ii) a suite of cognitive assessments designed to measure episodic memory, executive function and attention. CANTAB Connect should be used with each participant on their first visit to the clinical site to <em>administer three cognitive tests</em> and to help in activating the participant’s ThinkFast application.</p>

<h3 id="application-overview">
<a class="anchor" href="#application-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Application Overview</h3>

<p>This section describes the key features of the CANTAB Connect application:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Initial Study site: choose “idea-fast”</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>When you log into the platform you will select <strong>Training sites</strong> (if you are familiarising yourself with the Connect application) or your clinic site (if you are administering the assessments to a participant). There are separate sites for the Baseline testing completed on the iPad and a site for adding a participant to the <strong>ThinkFAST app</strong>. The ThinkFAST site should not be accessed on the iPad – this should be accessed via the admin application – instructions are provided below. When logging in select IDEA-FAST and your Site (or training if you are completing a practice session with no participant present). Active sites will include the status ‘Active’</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>System status (preparing offline vs offline ready)</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Once you have logged into the platform, in the top right-hand corner of the screen, ensure Online (offline ready) is displayed before you run a test session. You may notice this can take a few moments to update.</em></p>

<p>We recommend all testing sessions are completed online, with the iPad connected to Wi-Fi. This ensures the end of the testing session, and the data are automatically transferred to Cambridge Cognition.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Adding subjects for testing - iPad Configuration</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>To add the details of a participant for the iPad testing, from the main screen, tap on</em> <strong><em>Test a new Participant</em></strong> <em>as illustrated below:</em><br>

  <li><strong><em>Testing a Subject</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>After the Participant details have been entered in step 3, the Participant details will be displayed on screen. You can check these details are correct, if you need to make any changes or updates to the information entered tap</em> <strong><em>Edit</em></strong><em>. When you make any changes to the details previously entered you will be required to enter a reason for the change.</em></p>

<p><em>To begin the assessments, tap on</em> <strong><em>Start Test</em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/12.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>The first test start screen will be displayed, the name of the test is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen. The Participant should tap on Next to being the assessment. The voiceover instructions will start in the correct language for the Participant (as selected in step 3).</em></p>

<p><em>At the end of each assessment a similar screen will be displayed with the name of the next test to be administered.</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/13.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>End of the assessments</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>At the end of the assessments, the testing complete screen will be displayed. At this point the participant should pass the iPad back to the clinic staff. The final screen requires the clinic team member who logged into the Platform to being the testing session to enter their password:</em></p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/14.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/15.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Once you have entered your password the data collected as part of the testing session will be uploaded (if the iPad is connected to Wi-Fi). You will then return to the main screen.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Familiarising with Cognitive Tasks</em></strong></p>

<p>The CANTAB tasks included are Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Reaction Time (RTI) and One-Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS).</p>

<p><strong>Spatial Working Memory (SWM)</strong></p>

<p>SWM requires retention and manipulation of visuospatial information. This test has notable executive function demands, and measures strategy use as well as errors. In this task the participant has to search for tokens hidden in boxes. The participant must touch a box to open the box to reveal either a yellow token or an empty box. Once the participant has found a yellow token, they must touch the outline of the right-hand side of the screen to ‘store’ it. The participant must then continue searching through the boxes until all of the tokens have been found.</p>

<p>Voiceover instructions introduce the task and explain how the task is completed. The participant is informed that ‘the tokens will never be in the same box twice, so do not go back to a box if you have already found a token there’. The participant will then be asked to complete 2 practice trials, each containing 3 boxes/ tokens. If the participant returns to a box where a token has already been found, they are reminded that the tokens will never be in the same box twice, so do not go back to a box if you have already found a token there. After the participant has completed the 2 training problems, the voiceovers instructions introduce the assessed phase of the task during which the participant will be presented with 3 trials to complete, 1 containing 4 tokens, 1 containing 6 tokens and a final trial containing 8 tokens.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/16.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Reaction Time (RTI)</strong></p>

<p>RTI provides assays of motor and mental response speeds, as well as measures of movement time, reaction time and response accuracy. In this five-choice reaction time test, the participant will see five circles at the top of the screen and a button at the bottom of the screen. For each trial, the participant must hold down the button at the bottom of the screen until one of the five circles above flashes yellow. Once this has occurred, the participant must then release their finger and touch the circle which just flashed, as quickly as possible. Voiceover instructions introduce the task and explain how the task is completed. The subject is informed that ‘Both speed and accuracy are important, so go as quickly as you can, whilst trying not to make any mistakes and that ‘You will need to use the index finger of your dominant hand only: do not use two hands’. The subject will then be asked to practice holding the down the button at the bottom of the screen and is again informed that they should hold this button down until a yellow spot flashes in one of the circles above. The subject will then be presented with 10 practice trials, 2 from each of the 5 locations at the top of the screen, in a randomised order.</p>

<p>After the participant has completed the 10 training problems, the voiceovers instructions introduce the assessed phase of the task during which the participant will be presented with 30 trials, 6 from each of the 5 locations at the top of the screen, in a randomised order to complete.</p>

<p><strong>One-Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS)</strong></p>

<p>The One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS) task is a measure of executive function; planning and working memory. The participant is presented with two displays of ‘stockings’ each containing three coloured balls. There is a row of numbered boxes from 1 - 7 along the bottom of the screen. For each trial, the participant must mentally calculate how many moves are required to in order to match the bottom arrays of stockings to the top array of stockings. They must then touch the numbered box along the bottom of the screen corresponding to the number of moves they believe the problem can be solved in.</p>

<p><img src="../images/cantab_connect/17.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Voiceover instructions introduce the task and explain how the task is completed. The rules of the task are also presented and the participant is told that ‘ You cannot move a ball that is underneath another one’ and ‘You cannot move a ball into thin air; you have to move it into another free pocket, where it will drop to the bottom’. The participant will then be presented with a series of 3 mandatory training problems. The first two training problems will show the participant how to complete the presented problem before asking them to select the correct corresponding number. During the final training problem, the participant will be asked ‘What is the minimum number of moves I need to make? Touch one of the boxes below’ prior to being shown the solution to the problem. After the participant has completed the 3 training problems, the voiceovers instructions introduce the assessed phase of the task during which the participant will be presented with 15 problems of varying levels of difficulty to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Patient’s First Visit</strong></p>

<p>On the patient’s first visit to a study site you should: (i) add them for “testing” in CANTAB Connect; (ii) complete the initial cognitive tasks; (iii) add the participant to the CANTAB Connect admin application in the ThinkFAST site and (iiii) generate an activation code to onboard them into the ThinkFast mobile application on their personal smartphone as outlined above. Detailed instructions for the connecting with CANTAB ThinkFast are provided below:</p>

<p>Creating a User Account (for professionals)</p>

<p>You will need to log into the <a href="https://app.cantab.com/admin">CANTAB Connect admin</a> application via your laptop/PC and find the entry that was created by CANTAB for this participant as outlined below:</p>
