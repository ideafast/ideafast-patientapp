</ul><p>General Device Introduction</p>

<p>MoveMonitor records your movement as you go about your daily life, such as walking and sleeping. The movement data collected can be used to calculate a range of assessments, such as energy expenditure. MoveMonitor can record data for up to 7 days without needing to be charged.</p>

<p><strong>How does this device look?</strong></p>

<p>The device is a flat white sensor (Figure 1), it is easy to clean and wear at the lower back using the elastic strap provided (Figure 2).<strong>My McRoberts</strong>is a website (Figure 3) for configuring the MoveMonitor sensor prior to use in research.</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p>MoveMonitor automatically records anonymised movement data, such as_position_of body and the_speed_and_direction_that you move. My McRoberts then uses this data to create reports such as energy expenditure or movement during sleep.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>MoveMonitor is worn on the lower back (waist) using the elastic strap provided for 24/7 monitoring and up to 7 days of continuous measurements. The device is<strong>not waterproof</strong>and can be either worn on the skin or over clothing (preferably the first layer).</p>

<p>N DAYS= 5 days, up to 7 days of continuous measurement.</p>

<p>Make sure you wear the device in the position indicated by your clinician for the advised time frame. Your study period may last up to ($TIME_PERIOD – N DAYS) days. You will wear the sensor 24/7 - also during sleeping. Make sure you wear the MoveMonitor correctly. The device should be worn around the waist, at the middle of the lower back. The engraved McRoberts logo should be readable, and the waist belt should be on the inside. It can be worn directly on the skin or over a thin layer of clothes. Please note that the MoveMonitor is not waterproof, so it is not suitable for showering, bathing or swimming.</p>

<p>Due to the quantity of data recorded through MoveMonitor, it must be<strong>manually transferred from the device to a computer.</strong> MoveMonitor has an associated website where data can be uploaded, viewed, and automatically analysed to create reports on body posture, locomotion or sleep movements. This can be viewed at:<a href="https://www.mcroberts.nl/mymcroberts">https://www.mcroberts.nl/mymcroberts</a></p>

<p>The reports provide insights in energy expenditure (EE), including basal metabolic rate (BMR), diet induced thermo genesis (DIT), and physical activity (PA). The rates of EE during physical activity vary depending on intensity, duration, the frequency of the activity and on the body mass and fitness of the person performing the activity.</p>

  <li>The MoveMonitor needs to be cleaned after it has been worn so that it can be used for a new measurement.</li>
  <li>The waist belt can be washed by hand or with the washing machine at a maximum of 60°C.</li>
  <li>The MoveMonitor can be cleaned with rubbing alcohol (70%) to disinfect the device.</li>
  <li>A chlorine solution is possible (50000ppm). Make sure to remove the cleaning substance afterwards.</li>
  <li>Never clean the device by soaking in water. The MoveMonitor is not waterproof and can be irreparably damaged when doing so.</li>
</ul>
