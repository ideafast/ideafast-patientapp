<p>Stress Monitor is a mobile application that runs in the background and records anonymised data about other mobile application usage, movement activity, and location and uses this data to determine different types of behaviour. For example, if you had WhatsApp opened for 30 minutes when messaging friends, then Stress Monitor would record that you have used a “communication” application for 30-minutes while in location “1” where this number is used to represent your most frequent locations instead of actual geolocation information.</p>

<p>Stress Monitor also sends notifications to complete a short questionnaire as pre-determined times, which helps contextualise the mobile application usage data that it has recorded. These questionnaires relate to how you are feeling, are very short and can be completed within the Stress Monitor application.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-application-look">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-application-look" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this application look?</h2>

<p>Stress Monitor is a mobile application, which has a <em>bonsai tree icon</em> (illustrated to the right) that will appear when you install the application.<img src="../images/stress_monitor/1.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Stress Monitor has three screens – <em>Chart</em>, <em>Reporting</em> and <em>Settings</em> – that are illustrated below. <em>Chart</em> shows the categories it has created for your application usage over time. <em>Reporting</em> presents the number of entries Stress Monitor has recorded. <em>Settings</em> presents a link to the privacy policy and your user ID, which will appear as a long, randomly generated word.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it record?</h2>

<p>Stress Monitor records three categories of data: (i) the types of_applications_ that you’re using on your smartphone (e.g. “communication” and “shopping”); (ii) a predication of your <em>movement</em> (e.g. “running”, “in vehicle”) and (iii) a number to represent your <em>location</em> to understand where movement and application usage occurs more generally, for example, if you use shopping applications more when at one location. All data recorded by Stress Monitor is anonymised.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>There are two parts to Stress Monitor: (i) it automatically records application usage; and (ii) it sends questionnaire notifications. The first part requires no interaction with Stress Monitor as it will run in the background and record this data by itself.</p>

<p>Questionnaires are sent through Stress Monitor to help provide context for how you were feeling throughout the day at pre-determined times, which are currently <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00.</strong> A typical questionnaire is illustrated below to highlight its short length:</p>

<p>No. The <strong>Stress Monitor</strong> application records information in the background and will be installed on your personal smartphone. The application prompts questionnaires related to fatigue and sleep at pre-defined times: <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00.</strong> The questionnaires can be answered within one hour from the notification by clicking the banner on the top of screen, e.g. 9:00-10:00.</p>

<p>However, on your first visit you will need to download, install, and log into the stress monitor application on your personal Android smartphone or the provided smartphone. Once you are logged in, you will provide your <strong>hash id</strong> from within the application’s settings to the clinician. This helps us associate data collected within_stress monitor_ with other data collected through the study, such as eBedSensor. Details on how to view and access this are outlined in<a href="#needs-pairing-with-hub-device">section 3</a>.</p>

<p>The Stress Monitor application records mobile phone usage in the background about the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Application usage: the time that an application spends open per minute. The specific application is not identified and instead is assigned a category: “business”, “communication”, “entertainment”, “infotainment”, “shopping”, “social”, “travel/navigation/maps”, “utility”, “wellbeing”, “other”, and “unknown”.</li>
  <li>Screen on/off events.</li>
  <li>Activity as predicted by the Android platform: “in vehicle”, “on bicycle”, “on foot”, “walking”, “running”, “tilting”, “still”, and “unknown”.</li>
  <li>Location data provided as anonymised cluster identifiers. For the first two weeks of using the application, the phone collects geolocation, once a minute. This data is stored on the phone only. Once enough data is collected, this location is recorded and uploaded to a VTT server for routine detection and anonymisation. We utilise machine learning to find locations you visit often (such as your home, workplace, etc.) and assign numerical IDs (e.g. 0, 1, …) to the most visited ones. This mapping between geolocations and IDs is then sent to your phone, where it is used to categorise the data we collect. Only the ID of the location will be used - never the geolocation. The geolocations transferred to the server are not saved on the server, and once this process is completed, the original location data is deleted from your phone.</li>

<p>If the participant has an Android device, then you must ask if they are willing to install and register for the VTT Stress Monitor application on their personal device. If they are, then please guide them through the instructions below, otherwise user should log into the VTT Stress Monitor application on the Samsung A40 to be provided to the participant. This requires knowing the smartphone’s DEVICE_ID of looking up its associated email and password from the password vault. Once you have identified the device, please open the application (which is located on the home screen), and “Sign in with Google” using the associated password from the vault.</p>

<p><strong><em>Installing VTT Stress Monitor</em></strong></p>

<p>Please download and install the application direct from the Google Play Store. To do this, open the “Play Store” app, which looks like:<img src="../images/stress_monitor/6.jpeg" alt="">. Once open, search for ”<strong>stressmonitorV4</strong>” and tap the first result as below:</p>

<p><strong>Stress Monitor</strong> is a mobile application that runs in the background and records movement activity, location and information about your mobile usage, such as battery status. This data gives information about <em>behaviour</em> based on time, location and general mobile usage. Data is then grouped into categories, such as communication or social media.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The names of applications that are used are not stored anywhere, only the category that the application belongs to (e.g. communication/social) is collected.</li>
  <li>No data of the content of the applications (e.g. text typing, voice input) or the keystrokes is collected.</li>
  <li>No physical location data is collected. The location data is grouped into clusters with abstract identifiers (e.g. 1,2,3…) and only these identifiers are collected.</li>
  <li>No personal information is stored by the application that can be used to identify you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application also prompts questionnaires related to fatigue and sleep at pre-defined times: <strong>09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00,</strong> which must be answered within one hour by clicking the banner on the top of screen, e.g. 9:00-10:00. An example of the questionnaire appearing at 13:00 is presented in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="../images/stress_monitor/22.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> <em>Receiving a notification to complete the Stress Monitor questionnaire</em></p>

<p><strong>Question and Response Types</strong></p>

<p>The questions and associated response format change based on the time of day. There are four answer formats: <em>slider</em> as illustrated images <strong>A and B</strong>, <em>text entry</em> (where you write a response), pull down menu as illustrated in image <strong>C and D.</strong></p>
