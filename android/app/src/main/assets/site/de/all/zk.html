<p><img src="../images/zk/1.jpeg" alt="">The YOLI Sleep Monitor uses a Wi-Fi signal (radar) for monitoring and recording respiratory rate without requiring any interaction with the device. It can sense body movement up to 3 meters from the device and can detect different sleep conditions, such as sleep apnoea.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-device-look">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-device-look" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this device look?</h2>

<p>The YOLI is a small white box (Figure 1) that must be connected to Wi-Fi using a separate mobile application and should be placed next to your bed at waist height, such as on a bedside cabinet (Figure 2). The device has a power button on the front that can be used for turning it off when not in use, i.e. not sleeping. The YOLI has a yellow-green light on the side that shows Wi-Fi connectivity, which will always be on when the device is working correctly, or slowly flashing when it does not have a working internet connection.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it record?</h2>

<p>The YOLI automatically records respiration rate of nearby people every minute during the night.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The YOLI should be placed near your bed, ideally on a bedside table and at waist height (Figure 2). Once it is connected to a power source and added to your home Wi-Fi, or to a Wi-Fi hotspot provided by the study phone (if no home Wi-Fi is available), it will automatically begin monitoring your sleep health. Before you go to sleep, please make sure to use the switch on the front of the device (Figure 1) to turn it on and make sure the indicator light is on and not flashing. When you wake up and start your day, please turn the device off during the day to conserve energy and data bandwidth.</p>

<p>Yes. On the first day of providing the participant with the device you should log into the YOLI website and associate the device with a participant. This will allow you to use the website to check that the data is recorded successfully across the duration of the study.</p>

<p>Please log in to the <a href="https://nctms.zkboyue.com/">YOLI website</a> using the <strong>site credential</strong> on the encrypted password vault as <a href="https://docs.ideafast.eu/pro/hubcomputer#keepassx-password-manager">described in the computer setup documentation</a>. Once logged in, you need to add the device as a “bed” and associate it with a participant ID through the website. Please use the <em>participant ID</em> and <em>device id</em> when adding a new bed, for example P-ABC, and ZK1-Q2PNDF:</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/6.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can view the list of devices (”beds”). Tap ”Add bed” to add a new device:</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Enter the device ID (e.g. ZK1-Q2PNDF) and the participant’s ID for the bed. The device is associated with bed while you add the bed on the system. When a patient is booked into the bed, the system automatically associates the patient to the device.</p>

<p>Once a device is added, you can then add a note to remind you which participant each device is associated with:</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/8.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>The home screen will list each bed as a device used by a participant, when you add a bed to the system and register the participant in the corresponding bed. Data is displayed in the real-time, and you can log into the YOLI website and verify that each device has been used by participant at any time.</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/9.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you want to see the record of the monitoring data, you can check through “<strong>Today Data</strong>” or ”<strong>Historical Data</strong>”. And you can click the button of “<strong>Export Data</strong>” to download the physiological data.</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/10.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If these fields are empty, then the participant has not setup the device correctly and please contact them as soon as possible.</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/22.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once open, the home screen will show YOLO Wi-Fi configuration user interface where you need to enter the name and password of your home WiFi. This is required for YOLI to automatically upload data. If you are unsure what your home WiFi SSID (name) and password are, these are typically written on the back of your router that provides Internet to your home.</p>

<p><img src="../images/zk/23.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you do not have a home Wi-Fi, please enable and use the provided smartphone’s Wi-Fi hotspot as <a href="https://docs.ideafast.eu/pro/hubphone#enabling-hotspot">described here</a>.</p>
