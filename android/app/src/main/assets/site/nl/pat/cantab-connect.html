    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>CANTAB Connect is an iPad mobile application that has two components: (i) an administration area for clinical staff to login and create new participants as part of an ongoing study and to add those participants to the CANTAB ThinkFast app; and (ii) a suite of cognitive assessments designed to measure episodic memory, executive function and attention. CANTAB Connect should be used with each participant on their first visit to the clinical site to <em>administer three cognitive tests</em> and to help in activating the participant’s ThinkFast application.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">What does it record?</h2>

<p>CANTAB Connect records responses to specific tests that measure different aspects of cognition, such as visual memory through a gameful task (Figure 3) or the time taken to react, find and match a box to measure working memory (Figure 4).</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">How is it used?</h2>

<p>CANTAB Connect is used when a participant first visits a study site to gain a baseline measurement of their cognition and onboard them into the associated take-home cognitive app, <strong>ThinkFast</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-on-a-daily-basis-or-all-n-days">As a patient: do I need to do anything on a daily basis or all N days?</h2>

<p>Yes. On first visit to the clinical site you will be asked to perform a cognitive assessment on an iPad. After completion, a clinician will ask you to download the CANTAB ThinkFast application and open it. They will then provide you with a 6-digit code to use in ThinkFast that will log you in and therefore, any data recorded through ThinkFast will be anonymised.</p>

<p>CANTAB Connect is a mobile application that is used by clinical professionals on site to administrator one cognitive test to patients on their first visit and to create a new patient record. As part of creating the patient record in the admin application, participants will be provided with a code to log into the CANTAB ThinkFast mobile application on their personal smartphone.</p>

<p>If the CANTAB Connect application stops working, please close and reopen the application.</p>

<h3 id="battery">Battery?</h3>

<p>Please ensure that the iPad remains connected to the mains power using the lightening cable and charger. Ensure that the iPad is charged to at least 50% prior to each testing session.</p>

<h3 id="sounds">Sounds?</h3>

<p>There are voiceover instructions for the CANTAB tasks. Please ensure that the volume level is set so that the voiceover is audible. Sound can be increased or decreased by tapping the buttons on the right side of the iPad.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>Although the CANTAB assessments can be run without being connected to Wi-Fi, an internet connection is required for the data collected to be automatically transferred and backed up on Cambridge Cognition’s secure servers. When Wi-Fi is not available, the data will be stored locally on the iPad in a secure encrypted format and will be transferred to Cambridge Cognition as soon as the iPad is connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the iPad is connected to the Wi-Fi during each assessment. However, if this is not possible the user should ensure that the tablet is connected to Wi-Fi as regularly as possible so that subject data is transferred to Cambridge Cognition.</p>
