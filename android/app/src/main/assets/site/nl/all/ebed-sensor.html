<p>The eBedSensor is a pressure sensor that is placed under a mattress of a bed and records vital signs (e.g. heart rate, breathing rate) and motion. This data is then used to calculate a range of metrics that can be used to better understand sleep conditions, such as time spent in bed, sleep stages, and sleep apnea.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-device-look">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-this-device-look" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this device look?</h2>

<p>There are two parts using this sensor: the recording device named <strong>eBedSensor</strong> (Figure 1), and <strong>VitalTracker</strong>, a small touch-screen computer that stores the data (Figure 2). The eBedSensor should be placed under the mattress and connected to VitalTracker using a cable. The VitalTracker is then connected to a power socket using a USB cable, like when charging a phone. Only the power supply provided with the devices should be used as other power supplies can damage the devices.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it record?</h2>

<p>The eBedSensor records your vital signs (e.g. heart rate, breathing rate) and motion (e.g. acceleration, rotation and position) when you sleep.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it used?</h2>

<p>The eBedSensor is placed under a mattress on the slatted or cushion base and connected to the VitalTracker. VitalTracker is then plugged into a power source to begin recording. When you next go to bed, the eBedSensor will record your vital signs and movement. You can verify that data has been recorded by looking at the VitalTracker in the morning: the usage graph will have increased.</p>

<p>The <strong>eBedSensor</strong> must be placed under your mattress every night before sleep directly under where the patient sleeps as illustrated to the right.
The eBedSensor can be placed on both slatted and cushion bed bases. Please also check that the VitalTracker is connected properly both to the eBedSensor and the power supply at all times. The device can be powered on continuously 24 hours a day, or if needed, switched off and on; recording shall continue automatically whenever the device is powered.</p>

<p>No. Clinicians will transfer all the data stored on the VitalTracker at the end of the study period. Please pack away the BedSensor in the provided packaging and give it back to the researcher at the end of the study (either when you visit hospital or during the home visit).</p>

<p>No. However, if you are carrying out a home visit please check the placement of the eBedSensor is correct and is connected to the VitalTracker as outlined below. It is also recommended to check the correct date and time from the device screen, and if lagging more than some minutes, fix it with ‘SET TIME’ button. You may also make a copy of the recorded data with the dedicated USB flash drive, which runs automatically with few buttons to press and takes only few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The BedSensor should be stored when transporting in areas that do not exceed <strong>50+ Celsius</strong> otherwise sensitivity of the sensor foils will become permanently damaged. Therefore, when you first provide the sensor to a patient and when you pick it up, the bed sensor units must not be transported in a car trunk or left in a parked car as the temperatures can exceed 50+ C.</p>

<p>Yes. You must manually transfer data from the VitalTracker device to a USB flash drive, which requires connecting the provided USB flash drive directly to VitalTracker and pressing the “<strong>Data » USB</strong>” button as illustrated below. This will start the transferring data process and a progress bar will appear to notify you when data has successfully been transferred. There is also a separate screen for removing data from the VitalTracker, which should be done prior to giving the eBedSensor to another participant. You should at least verify that data exists on the USB Drive, and it is also recommended to copy the data also to PC or cloud, prior to deleting any data from VitalTracker.</p>

<p><img src="../images/bed_sensor/4.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Data shall be copied automatically into the USB flash drive into a folder name with the device serial number, which is also presented on the VitalTracker screen. Data files typically represent 24-hour recordings containing the starting time information in the filename.</p>

<p>The Bed Sensor automatically records three types of data files, named as <em>RAW.DAT</em>, <em>SIG.DAT</em> and <em>HRB.DAT</em>. These files extend in maximum up to 24 hours duration and are automatically changed each day at 11AM. Filesize of 24 hours recording is about 230 Mbytes.</p>

<p>The same flash memory stick can be used to copy multiple devices as each device data shall be automatically copied under different folder names. However, six weeks pilot data shall consume about 10 GB of data space, so the provided 32 GBs memory sticks can in most optimal case contain only up to three devices data.</p>

<p>Follow-up the participant and complete the device evaluation questionnaire.</p>

<p>The <strong>eBedSensor</strong> is an unobtrusive, dynamic pressure sensor that is placed under the mattress of a bed to record patients physiological vitals (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate, etc.) and motion. These are then used to calculate e.g. time spent in bed, sleep staging, nocturnal stress recovery, and sleep apnea.</p>

<p>Data is automatically transferred and stored on a small, external computer with a touch screen (named VitalTracker). This data is not automatically uploaded to the web and must be manually transferred via a USB flash drive using the VitalTracker interface as outlined above. The VitalTracker local disc space can hold data up to two months, so the whole 6 weeks recording can be copied at the end of the trial. However, if visiting the patient, it would be informative to collect bed sensor data also during the pilot and share it for VTT who can verify that each bed sensor is operating correctly.</p>

<p>After the trial period is complete and all data is safely transferred, the data from VitalTracker should be removed before moving the device to a new patient. This can be done using the touch screen interface.</p>

<p>Pre-inspection is required to ensure the device and its parts are not damaged. To do this, connect the eBedSensor with the VitalTracker, turn them on. The VitalTracker screen should turn and provide details of the current time as illustrated below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/bed_sensor/5.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Device serial number is visible in the screen at bottom left corner (in the figure the field ‘0000000062381529’). Please check that this deviceID is linked with the patientID in your notes.</p>

<p>The device shall record data automatically whenever it is power on: the “power off” button will show when powered on. After several hours recording, the percentage for the free space (85%) should decrease. In case of malfunction and the main screen is not visible and does not respond to touch, please reboot the device by disconnecting the power plug.</p>

<p>Next, verify that the date and time are correct in VitalTracker by checking the date on its screen with your watch or mobile phone time. The selection for setting time is under ‘SETTINGS’. If they are incorrect, tap “Set Time” and update the time accordingly. The following screens will appear in sequence after pressing ‘SETTINGS’:</p>

<p><img src="../images/bed_sensor/6.jpeg" alt=""><img src="../images/bed_sensor/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Prior to reusing the eBedSensor/VitalTracker with a new patient, you must ensure that all data has been safely transferred and uploaded as per <a href="#as-a-professional-do-i-need-to-do-anything-after-the-full-periods-of-use-of-a-specific-device--app-ends-for-each-patient-using-a-specific-device--app">the data transfer protocol described above</a>. You must then remove data from the VitalTracker using the touch screen interface.</p>

<p>To firstly copy data to USB, insert the provided USB Pen Drive into the VitalTracker, wait a moment for it to connect, then tap the activated “DATA » USB” to copy data to the USB memory. After copied, the ‘OK’ button will appear green and info in the screen says 100% is copied. The bed sensor data recording will automatically restart already before pressing the ‘OK’ button, which only releases the function to the main screen.</p>

<p><img src="../images/bed_sensor/8.jpeg" alt=""><img src="../images/bed_sensor/9.jpeg" alt=""><img src="../images/bed_sensor/10.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>After the data has been copied, it is possible to remove data from the copied data device, but firstly you should to take out the USB stick, to check and double copy data to your PC. After inserting the USB stick again to the connector, the ‘DELETE DATA THAT HAS BEEN COPIED’ turns red as being enabled. Another choice for ‘DELETE ALL DATA’ is enabled without confirming the data exists in the inserted USB memory stick.</p>

<p><img src="../images/bed_sensor/11.jpeg" alt=""><img src="../images/bed_sensor/12.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Whichever you choose as an option for deleting data from the device, you need to give the provided pin code for deleting the data. After that the requested deletion operation is finished and the percentage of free space will increase back to normal. Once this is done, the device is ready to be used by another participant.</p>

<p>NOTE: The sensor foil should not be exposed to temperatures above +55C during transportation (temperature degradation is non-linear and above +80C it stands for few minutes only). Therefore, during hot days, the bed sensor units must not be transported in a car trunk or left into the parked car, when the temperature might rise above +50C. This also must be considered with the courier depending on the season.</p>

<p>The <strong>eBedSensor</strong> (<em>figure 1</em>) is placed under the mattress of a bed and connected to a small digital recording device called a <strong>VitalTracker</strong> (<em>figure 2</em>). The VitalTracker records your vital signs and movement while you sleep and should be placed on a bedside table or another platform so that it remains on the same level of the eBedSensor. This will prevent the cable from breaking.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#placing-the-ebedsensor-under-your-bed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Placing the eBedsensor under your bed</h2>

<p>Place the sensor <strong>under</strong> your mattress as shown in the picture below. However, the mattress in Figure 1 above should be of a homogeneous material, e.g. a foam mattress with thickness up to 15 cm would do fine. In case of a partly hollow and structured mattress like a spring-box mattress, the bed sensor should be placed in between a thin topping or covering mattress and the spring-box mattress.</p>

      <td>Figure 1: Typical mattress and bedding.</td>
      <td>Figure 2: Device placed under mattress.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">
<a class="anchor" href="#connectivity-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>In case of non-functioning main screen, restart the device by disconnecting and (after a few seconds) reconnecting the power supply cord, which should enable the normal operation and automatic data recording. However, if you still see an error message on a screen of the VitalTracker or the touch screen does not seem to activate at all, send it to the research site.</p>

<h3 id="checking-bed-status">
<a class="anchor" href="#checking-bed-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Checking Bed Status</h3>

<p>Please ensure each night that the eBedSensor is plugged into the VitalTracker following the <a href="#devicehow-to-setup-for-wear">setup guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mattress-types">
<a class="anchor" href="#mattress-types" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mattress Types</h3>

<p>The bed sensor does not work optimally with some specific mattress types, which dampen the signal strength. Common mattresses that cause dampening issues contain non-homogenous structures, such as springs. Improvement on measurement conditions can be done by adding a <strong>topping mattress (or additional bed sheet)</strong> and <strong>place the sensor under it</strong>. This is not necessary in most of the cases, like e.g. a homogeneous foam rubber with thickness up to 15 cm.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#need-to-restart-or-log-in-again" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Need to restart or log in again?</h3>

<p>The <em>eBedSensor</em> can be turned off from the display of the VitalTracker. It can be restarted by switching off and from the power supply.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, the power supply cord can also be disconnected directly without pre-selected power-off from the touch screen, however in very rare occasions this might damage the internal SD-card.</p>

<p>The VitalTracker recording will automatically turn on after a power failure and resume operation without user intervention.</p>
