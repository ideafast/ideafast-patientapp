<p><img src="../images/dreem/1.jpeg" alt="">The Dreem 2 device is a wireless headband that can record, store, and automatically analyse brain function such as sleep activity, in real-time without any connection (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>What does it record?</strong></p>

<p>The headband had sensors on the front and back of the device that records brain wave activity and movement data, which is used to calculate sleep stages. This data is stored on the headband then uploaded to the Internet when the Dreem 2 headband is connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>The Dreem 2 headband is worn on the head during sleeping. It has sensors embedded in the front and back parts of the headband to ensure it records accurate reading while you move during sleep. The headband is flexible and can be adjusted to accommodate all head shapes and sizes. The sensors within the Dreem 2 headband should be in direct contact with the skin similar to how it is positioned below.</p>

<p>As a patient: do I need to do anything on a daily basis or all N days?</p>

<p>Yes. On your first day of receiving the Dreem 2 headband you should connect it your home Wi-Fi. On days where you will be asked to wear the Dreem 2 headband you should: (i) adjust the headband placement to ensure it records accurate data; and (ii) charge it after a night’s wear. Detailed instructions for these activities are outlined in Section 6.</p>

<p>Yes. After a participant has worn a device for 2<strong>days</strong> you should<strong>verify that they have connected the device to Wi-Fi and uploaded data.</strong>You can do thisthrough the Dreem 2 website as outlined below.</p>

<h2 id="verify-data-uploaded-by-participant">
<a class="anchor" href="#verify-data-uploaded-by-participant" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>Verify Data Uploaded by Participant</em>
</h2>

<p>Each participant will connect the provided Dreem 2 headband to their home Wi-Fi, which will automatically upload data to the Dreem 2 servers once the device is on charge. The Dreem 2 headband stores 80-hours of recording on a headband and so it is important to verify that the data has been uploaded and is of good quality (to ensure the headband is worn correctly). If it is not, then please contact the participant to provide further assistance.</p>

<h2 id="login">
<a class="anchor" href="#login" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong><em>Login</em></strong>
</h2>

<p>Data uploaded by each participant is stored on Dreem 2’s website (<a href="https://ts-viewer.rythm.co">https://ts-viewer.rythm.co</a>) and can be accessed using the<strong>site credential</strong> on the provided_encrypted vault._To access this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Records availability</em></strong></p>

<p>Once logged in, you will then see a list of recordings, when they took place, their duration and on what device. For each recording, the email address associated with the provided Samsung smartphone, the device ID, the start time and the duration of the recording are listed.<strong>The “user” and “device” will help you identify which records to view.</strong></p>

<p>Records are organised by upload order where the newest appears first. There are two types of records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grey records are recordings that have been successfully uploaded to the servers.</li>
  <li>Red records are recordings that have<strong>not been successfully uploaded to the server.</strong> This is typically due to having no Wi-Fi connection or the headband has not yet been plugged in.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/5.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 12: Dreem 2 portal for viewing uploaded data</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Record quality check assessment</em></strong></p>

<p>The procedure to assess the quality of a recording is detailed below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 1. Record data metrics check</em></strong></p>

<p>On the home page, click on the desired record to display the record dashboard at the bottom of the screen (Figure 13). This provides further details based on signal quality for the chosen record.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/6.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 13: Dreem 2 portal – Home page with record dashboard</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Channel indexes of the recording</em></strong></p>

<p>Under the ‘Quality’ section you will see the_frontal_and_occipital_index channels, which report a<strong>percentage</strong>to show the overall quality of the recording. The quality value is deemed satisfactory if it is &gt;=<strong>0.7</strong>as outlined in Table 2:</p>

<p>Table 2: Average index channel quality thresholds</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th> </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Average index channel</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Indication</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.7-1</td>
      <td>Success</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.55-0.69</td>
      <td>Borderline – Note as failure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.01-0.54</td>
      <td>Failure</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong><em>Step 2. Manually Verify Data Quality</em></strong></p>

<p>Manual record inspection of the raw Dreem 2 data will need to be performed for each recording where the index channel is borderline or failure (&lt; 0.69). Double-click on the desired record and a new page will appear where you can access to the entire raw recording.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Setting Workspace</strong></p>

<p>By clicking the toolbox in the viewer, you will be able to set parameters for the viewing, such as epoch duration, channels displayed, etc.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/7.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 15. Morpheo Viewer with Toolbox open</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Choosing Signals</strong></p>

<p>Click ‘<strong>Select Signals</strong>’ in the toolbar (Figure 15) to configure all available signals. From the ‘<strong>select signals</strong>’ menu, you can drag any signal from ‘available’ to ‘selected’. This will allow visualisation of the channels raw data in the viewer. You can also drag the signal box up and down, to change its viewing location in the viewer. Press<strong>‘multiplot’</strong>at the bottom right to implement your desired workspace / montage.</p>

<p>Note: Scales and filters of record signals have been pre-processed. They are not necessary to set for Dreem 2 record inspections. The recommended workspace for record inspection includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>7 EEG Channels.</li>
      <li>1 accelerometer (Norm) channel that will detect subject movements (which can also result in loss of good quality signal).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Scroll through record</strong></p>

<p>Press the right and left arrows (Figure 16) to move the signal viewing window forward or back by 10 seconds. Pressing the_enter_ button will move the window forward by 30 seconds (one epoch).</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/8.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 16. Morpheo Viewer Signal Selection Window</strong></p>

<p><strong>4.</strong><strong>Record Inspection</strong></p>

<p>Scroll through the record and note record quality of the EEG:<strong>good quality is determined if there are no missing data</strong>. Sleep onset, sleep biomarkers (sleep spindles, K-complexes, delta waves, etc.), and sleep stages should be visualised through the record in the EEG.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/9.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 17: Good signal quality – Stage 2 sleep with sleep spindles is easily distinguished.</strong></p>

<p>When these features cannot be detected, the epochs should be noted as poor quality signal. Over 2 hours of poor-quality signal will be noted as a record failure.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/10.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 18: Poor signal quality- Sleep stage and biomarkers are not easily distinguished.</strong></p>

<p>Records can have good signal quality in some channels with poor signal quality in other channels. The signal quality is still considered acceptable when one occipital and one frontal EEG channel has sleep stage / sleep biomarker deductible signals.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/11.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure 19: Acceptable signal quality - Poor signal originating from F7 sensor. However, one frontal and 3 occipital channels are of good quality. This is acceptable for good signal quality.</strong></p>

<p>If the signal quality is not satisfactory, you may want to contact the patient to provide guidance on how to better place the headband to ensure optimal sleep signal quality.</p>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> There are<strong>five steps</strong> concerning data transfer that must be followed after the full study period:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the Dreem 2 headband to Wi-Fi to<strong>upload any remaining data</strong>.</li>
  <li>Log into the associated website to view and<strong>download this data to your work computer</strong>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Upload participant’s data</strong> to the IDEA-FAST data hub.</li>
  <li>Create a<strong>local backup</strong> of the participant’s data on the provided external hard drive.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reinstall</strong>the Dreem 2 app on the device smartphone before a new participant uses it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1. Upload Data</strong></p>

<p>All data from the Dreem 2 headband should be automatically uploaded by participants through their home Wi-Fi during the study period. After the full wear period, please connect the smartphone to Internet and setup the headband to a local Wi-Fi using instructions in<strong>Section 2</strong>. Once connected, place the headband on charge (see Section 2) and verify that the participant had no red records (i.e. data that is not uploaded) through Dreem 2’s Viewer web interface.</p>

<p><strong>2. Downloading Data</strong></p>

<p>Data that has been uploaded from the Dreem 2 headband will be stored on Dreem 2’s servers and can be viewed using the<strong>Dreem 2 Viewer</strong> application. Please login using your site credentials as outlined in . Once logged in, you will see data from all participants across sites.<strong>USER</strong>is the ID of the smartphone (e.g.<strong>A40-5AF59F)</strong> and the<strong>DEVICE</strong>is the ID of the Dreem 2 headband (e.g.<strong>DRM-GE7FXG)</strong>: both IDs will be attached as labels on the device.</p>

<p><strong><em>Wearing the headband</em></strong></p>

<p>DREEM 2 is embedded with sensors located on the<strong>front</strong>and<strong>back</strong>of the headband. To ensure optimal signal quality, it is essential that all the sensors are in direct contact with the skin on the forehead and scalp in the back part of the head. The headband should be adjusted on your first site visit.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/41.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Figure N.</strong> 4 EEG electrodes for measuring brain activity and one pulse sensor (that lights green) to measure heart rate are located on the part of the headband worn on the forehead.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adjusting the headband</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/dreem/42.jpeg" alt="">There are three sizes of adjustment strips (S, M, L) (Fig. 3, a). The headband uses an elastic, Velcro strap to accommodate a variation of head sizes: three sizes of adjustment strap are provided (S, M, L). To adjust the size, detach the Velcro from the back of the headband, add a new strap, attach the red circles to Velcro and close it. A tighter headband will lead to better skin contact, resulting in more accurate data being recorded.</p>

<p><strong><em>Positioning the headband</em></strong></p>

<p>There are three steps to ensure the headband is placed firmly on the head for optimal recording.</p>
