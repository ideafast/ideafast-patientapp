<p>The VitalPatch is a disposable chest-worn sensor for monitoring vital signs, such as: heart rate, body temperature and movement. The VitalPatch records data and stores it on the device every few seconds. The patch then sends this data to a mobile application via Bluetooth when it has a connection. The battery in the patch lasts for five-days and cannot be recharged.</p>

<p>An overview of the VitalPatch’s shape and components is illustrated below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/3.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong><em>the top (to power on) and bottom (to attach to skin) view of the VitalPatch.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-record">What does it record?</h2>

<p>The VitalPatch records body movements and posture (standing, sitting, etc.), heart rate, respiratory (breathing) rate, body temperature and skin temperature.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-used">How is it used?</h2>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/4.jpeg" alt="" />The VitalPatch is applied to one of two positions in the upper left side of the chest as illustrated to the right. Body hair should be removed where the patch will be placed to ensure a good connection. It can be worn during a shower but exposure directly under the shower head should be minimal. Do not submerge the VitalPatch in water or use in a sauna.</p>

<h1 id="data-transfer-protocol-for-patients">Data transfer protocol for patients</h1>

<h2 id="as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-on-a-daily-basis-or-all-n-days">As a patient: do I need to do anything on a daily basis or all N days?</h2>

<p>To start using a VitalPatch, please follow the instructions <a href="#as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-after-my-full-periods-of-use-of-a-specific-device--app-ends">below</a> to attach the VitalPatch to your chest and turn it on. Once the VitalPatch is turned on, it will automatically connect to its mobile application on the provided Samsung device and transfer data if the phone has Bluetooth enabled and is within range. As data is transferred via Bluetooth (in a range of 10 metres (32ft)), we recommend that you always carry the provided smartphone with you. If you lose connectivity between the patch and mobile phone, data is stored on the patch and will be transmitted once the phone has connectivity again. Please ensure that the mobile device provided to you (“study phone”) is placed near your bed when you sleep to accommodate data transfer in the night. You need to ensure the mobile device is kept charged.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-after-each-individual-period-of-device--app-use-ended">As a patient: do I need to do anything after each individual period of device / app use ended?</h2>

<p>After using the device for 5 days it will be out of battery. To ensure that the patch has stopped recording please cut the patch in half. The old patch can be disposed of in the regular waste (it is fitted with a special type of battery that can safely be put into household waste).</p>

<h2 id="as-a-patient-do-i-need-to-do-anything-after-my-full-periods-of-use-of-a-specific-device--app-ends">As a patient: do I need to do anything after my full periods of use of a specific device / app ends?</h2>

<p>Yes. After your period of use ends, you will have a follow-up telephone call with the clinical researcher to discuss your monitoring period.</p>

<h1 id="devicehow-to-setup-for-wear">Device How To / setup for wear </h1>

<p>The VitalPatch must be applied to the chest so that the logo side and battery are facing upwards, as shown in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/16.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure N:</strong><em>The top (to power on) and bottom (to attach to skin) view of the VitalPatch.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>There are seven steps to preparing and applying the VitalPatch to your chest and connecting it to the HealthStream application:</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="step-1-handling-vitalpatch">Step 1: Handling VitalPatch</h2>

<p>Prior to applying the VitalPatch to your chest you must clean and dry your hands to remove any dirt. Do not touch the adhesive on the VitalPatch.<img src="../images/vital_patch/17.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-2-prepare-skin">Step 2: Prepare skin</h2>

<p>The VitalPatch should be attached on the_upper left chest (left-hand side for the wearer)_. If the device cannot be placed here, then use the second application site instead (see Figure N). The second application site is located just left of the centreline, below the chest on the rib cage. For a good connection and proper operation, the patch should NOT be worn over areas with a lot of body hair. Remove body hair in the area of device placement before applying the device. See image to the left.<img src="../images/vital_patch/18.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>#Step 3: Remove VitalPatch from pouch</p>

<p>Tear open the pouch using the notch mark and remove the device carefully to<strong><em>avoid pressing the Power Button</em>.</strong> Please do not yet dispose the pouch or the adhesive backing with the device Bluetooth ID number as you will need this information to connect to the mobile application. The Bluetooth ID number can be found on the pouch label or on the adhesive backing in both human readable and barcode formats.<img src="../images/vital_patch/19.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Clean the chest area before use with soap and water and dry thoroughly. The application site should be free of oils and lotions to maximise adhesion. You must shave this area with a razor to be free from any hair. After showering or exposing the device to water, please wipe it down with a dry cloth. This ensures that the label printed onto the device does not peel off.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-power-on-the-vitalpatch">Step 4: Power-on the VitalPatch</h2>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/20.jpeg" alt="" />Locate and press the Power Button off centred on the device. Look for a green light illuminating temporarily to confirm the device is powered on as illustrated in the image to the left. This button will only flash briefly and turns off afterwards (even though the patch is on). If you are not sure whether the device was turned on successfully, please continue to follow the next steps as instructed and you will be able to see whether turning the device on worked once you reach step 7 as the VitalPatch will connect to the mobile application and a notification will be displayed.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-position-patch-on-the-chest">Step 5: Position patch on the chest.</h2>

<p>With the adhesive backings still adhered (see image to the right), place the patch on a flat body surface on the left chest with one side. This should be roughly two fingers below the collar bone and angled toward the heart as illustrated to the right. While the exact angle is not critical, it is more important to attach the patch to the flattest surface of the chest to prevent it slipping when moving. The battery side of the device should be pointed to the left side of the patient’s chest. <img src="../images/vital_patch/21.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The logo on the patch should be positioned so it is readable by someone facing you. The battery will be closest to the left side of the chest. If the device cannot be placed in the Primary Location use the Secondary Location instead, which is located just left of the centreline, below the rib cage as illustrated above (see Figure N).</p>

<h2 id="step-6-apply-patch-to-body">Step 6: Apply patch to body.</h2>

<p>Hold one end of the patch against the chest. Lift the other side and grab the adhesive backing tab located near the centre of the device. Without touching the adhesive, pull the tab to remove the adhesive backing and press the patch down to apply. Repeat this process to apply the other side of the patch. Press down on both ends of the device to ensure it is well adhered to skin. Please avoid exercise and any exposure of the device to splash water for 30 minutes from when the VitalPatch is applied to your chest.<img src="../images/vital_patch/22.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="step-7-connecting-to-mobile-application">Step 7: Connecting to Mobile Application</h2>

<p>MBS Health Application automatically starts when the phone is switched on. If no VitalPatch is detected, it will keep searching until one is found. Please make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on the phone. Note: the green power light only flashes briefly when the patch is first turned on. The phone will indicate that the patch is synced (not the light). No user input is required. When the mobile device is switched on, the status of vital sign monitoring will appear as notifications</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/23.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Notification sent from the MBS Health application</p>

<p>There are three status messages that you will likely see during the trial:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>“MBS Health service Started.”</strong> – when the VitalPatch is first connected.</li>
  <li><strong>“Monitoring on patch PATCH_ID.”</strong> – the VitalPatch is connected and automatically transferring data to the app.</li>
  <li><strong>“Trying to connect to patch.”</strong> – when the VitalPatch has lost connection, such as, when out of range. Note: the VitalPatch device will continue to try and connect until it is successful.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="powering-on-the-vitalpatch">Powering on the VitalPatch</h2>

<p>If VitalPatch does not automatically connect to the app within a few minutes, it may be the case that the power-on as instructed above in Step 4 did not work. If that appears to be the case, please attempt to power it up one more time as follows:</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/24.jpeg" alt="" />Once the VitalPatch has been attached to your chest you can turn it on by pressing the Power Button. A green light will flash temporarily to confirm the device has been switched on. Once the device has been successfully activated, this light will not continue to flash during wear.</p>

<h2 id="the-device--app-seems-to-have-stopped-working-what-should-i-do">The device / app seems to have stopped working: what should I do?</h2>

<h3 id="battery">Battery?</h3>

<p>The battery of the VitalPatch will last 5 days. If the battery is dead, you will not be able to connect in the mobile application as outlined above, and no further data will be recorded. If data has not yet been synchronised to the phone using the app before the VitalPatch runs out of battery, then any data not yet transferred is lost.</p>

<h3 id="connectivity-issues">Connectivity issues?</h3>

<p>If connection to your mobile device has failed, check that your mobile device supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and that the Bluetooth settings on your mobile device are on. If Bluetooth is enabled but the connection still fails, restart your mobile device and try connecting again. If the battery in your patch is exhausted, you will not be able to connect.</p>

<h3 id="no-connection-after-30-minutes">No Connection after 30-minutes?</h3>

<p>If for any reason during the study the HealthStream mobile application is searching for the patch for <strong>more than 30 minutes</strong> even though it is in range and patch is still within 5 days battery, please <a href="https://docs.ideafast.eu/pat/hubphone#restarting-phone">restart the provided Samsung Smartphone</a>.</p>

<h3 id="need-to-restart-or-log-in-again">Need to restart or log in again?</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-device--app-is-uncomfortable-to-me-what-can-i-do">Using the device / app is uncomfortable to me: what can I do?</h2>

<p>VitalPatch should be worn 24-hours a day for 5 consecutive days. Once the VitalPatch is attached to the chest it should not be removed. However, if it becomes extremely uncomfortable to wear, hot, or causes skin irritation, please remove it and contact the study site team immediately. Do not wear the devices over any open wounds or irritated skin.</p>

<p><img src="../images/vital_patch/25.jpeg" alt="" /> If mild soreness or redness is experienced after removing the device, do not apply a new device in the same location. Choose another recommended location, e.g. below the pectoral or on the chest as illustrated to the right.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-wear-style">Adjust wear style?</h3>

<p>Once the VitalPatch has been applied to your chest and it should not be adjusted as this will destroy the adhesive and cause the device to record inaccurate data or/and become detached from your chest. If you experience skin irritation or it is uncomfortable to wear, <a href="#how-can-i-get-help-with-using-this">please contact your study site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="adjust-usage-pattern">Adjust usage pattern?</h3>

<p>Not applicable. Once the VitalPatch has been attached to the chest it should not be removed unless extremely uncomfortable, hot, or causes skin irritation, as described above.</p>

<h1 id="device-return">Device return</h1>

<h2 id="what-do-i-do-when-a-period-of-device-use-is-over">What do I do when a period of device use is over?</h2>

<p>Cut the old patch in half and dispose in regular waste. The battery does not need to be removed as it is also safely disposable in household waste.</p>

<h2 id="before-the-device-is-returned-or-disposed-of-does-any-data-need-to-be-transferred">Before the device is returned or disposed of: does any data need to be transferred?</h2>

<p>No. Once the VitalPatch is activated and synced with the provided mobile device the data is automatically transferred to phone. You must return this phone at the end of the study period. The data will then be retrieved by study support staff at your local study centre.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-return-the-device-somewhere">Do I need to return the device somewhere?</h2>

<p>The VitalPatch devices do not need to be returned. However, the study phones provided to you will need to be returned at the end of the study period. Please see .</p>
